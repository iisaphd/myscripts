Converting an older site to a Joomla! 1.5 site requires creation of a new empty site using Joomla! 1.5 and then populating the new site with the content from the old site. This migration of content is not a one-to-one process and involves conversions and modifications to the content dump.</p> <p>There are two ways to perform the migration:</p>', ' <div id="post_content-107"><li>An automated method of migration has been provided which uses a migrator Component to create the migration dump out of the old site (Mambo 4.5.x up to Joomla! 1.0.x) and a smart import facility in the Joomla! 1.5 Installation that performs required conversions and modifications during the installation process.</li> <li>Migration can be performed manually. This involves exporting the required tables, manually performing required conversions and modifications and then importing the content to the new site after it is installed.</li>  <p><!--more--></p> <h2><strong> Automated migration</strong></h2>  <p>This is a two phased process using two tools. The first tool is a migration Component named <font face="courier new,courier">com_migrator</font>. This Component has been contributed by Harald Baer and is based on his <strong>eBackup </strong>Component. The migrator needs to be installed on the old site and when activated it prepares the required export dump of the old site''s data. The second tool is built into the Joomla! 1.5 installation process. The exported content dump is loaded to the new site and all conversions and modification are performed on-the-fly.</p> <h3><u> Step 1 - Using com_migrator to export data from old site:</u></h3> <li>Install the <font face="courier new,courier">com_migrator</font> Component on the <u><strong>old</strong></u> site. It can be found at the <a href="http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/pasamioprojects/frs/" target="_blank" title="JoomlaCode">JoomlaCode developers forge</a>.</li> <li>Select the Component in the Component Menu of the Control Panel.</li> <li>Click on the <strong>Dump it</strong> icon. Three exported <em>gzipped </em>export scripts will be created. The first is a complete backup of the old site. The second is the migration content of all core elements which will be imported to the new site. The third is a backup of all 3PD Component tables.</li> <li>Click on the download icon of the particular exports files needed and store locally.</li> <li>Multiple export sets can be created.</li> <li>The exported data is not modified in anyway and the original encoding is preserved. This makes the <font face="courier new,courier">com_migrator</font> tool a recommended tool to use for manual migration as well.</li> <h3><u> Step 2 - Using the migration facility to import and convert data during Joomla! 1.5 installation:</u></h3><p>Note: This function requires the use of the <em><font face="courier new,courier">iconv </font></em>function in PHP to convert encodings. If <em><font face="courier new,courier">iconv </font></em>is not found a warning will be provided.</p> <li>In step 6 - Configuration select the ''Load Migration Script'' option in the ''Load Sample Data, Restore or Migrate Backed Up Content'' section of the page.</li> <li>Enter the table prefix used in the content dump. For example: ''jos_'' or ''site2_'' are acceptable values.</li> <li>Select the encoding of the dumped content in the dropdown list. This should be the encoding used on the pages of the old site. (As defined in the _ISO variable in the language file or as seen in the browser page info/encoding/source)</li> <li>Browse the local host and select the migration export and click on <strong>Upload and Execute</strong></li> <li>A success message should appear or alternately a listing of database errors</li> <li>Complete the other required fields in the Configuration step such as Site Name and Admin details and advance to the final step of installation.

Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>', '', -2, 4, 0, 29, '2008-08-12 22:33:10', 62, '', '2008-08-12 22:33:10', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-11 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 11, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 73, 'robots=\nauthor=');

Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.

Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software.

Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla!

Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language.

The new implementation is fully backward compatible.</p>\nNo you don''t. Versions of MySQL lower than 4.1 do not have built in UTF-8 support. However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more. The Documentation Team helps oversee the wiki but you are invited to contribute content, as well.</p> <p>There are also books written about Joomla! You can find a listing of these books in the <a href="http://shop.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Shop">Joomla!

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more. The Documentation Team helps oversee the wiki but you are invited to contribute content, as well.</p> <p>There are also books written about Joomla! You can find a listing of these books in the <a href="http://shop.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Shop">Joomla!

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation.

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.

Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends.

You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.', '', -2, 3, 0, 27, '2008-08-11 09:12:55', 62, '', '2008-08-11 09:12:55', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 10:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 3, 'robots=\nauthor=');

The new implementation is fully backward compatible.</p>\nNo you don''t. Versions of MySQL lower than 4.1 do not have built in UTF-8 support. However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more.

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen.

The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla!

Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language.

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>', '', -2, 3, 0, 28, '2008-08-10 23:13:33', 62, '', '2008-08-10 23:13:33', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 04:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 5, 'robots=\nauthor=');

The new implementation is fully backward compatible.</p>\nNo you don''t. Versions of MySQL lower than 4.1 do not have built in UTF-8 support. However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more.

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.', '', -2, 3, 0, 31, '2008-08-11 15:14:11', 62, '', '2008-08-11 15:14:11', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 12:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 8, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 6, 'robots=\nauthor=');

The new implementation is fully backward compatible.</p>\nNo you don''t. Versions of MySQL lower than 4.1 do not have built in UTF-8 support. However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more. The Documentation Team helps oversee the wiki but you are invited to contribute content, as well.</p> <p>There are also books written about Joomla! You can find a listing of these books in the <a href="http://shop.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Shop">Joomla!

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.', '', -2, 3, 0, 32, '2008-08-11 17:14:57', 62, '', '2008-08-11 17:14:57', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 14:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 7, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 6, 'robots=\nauthor=');

However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more. The Documentation Team helps oversee the wiki but you are invited to contribute content, as well.</p> <p>There are also books written about Joomla! You can find a listing of these books in the <a href="http://shop.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Shop">Joomla!

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.\n<p>You indeed can change the Menu Item''s Type to whatever you want,   even after they have been created. </p><p>If,   for instance, you want to change the Blog Section of a Menu link, go to the Control Panel-&gt;Menus Menu-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Item Manager and edit the Menu Item. Select the <strong>Change Type</strong> button and choose the new style of Menu Item Type from the available list. Thereafter, alter the Details and Parameters to reconfigure the display for the new selection  as you require it.</p>', '', -2, 3, 0, 31, '2008-08-10 23:15:36', 62, '', '2008-08-10 23:15:36', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 04:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 18, 'robots=\nauthor=');

How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places.

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.\n<p>You indeed can change the Menu Item''s Type to whatever you want,   even after they have been created. </p><p>If,   for instance, you want to change the Blog Section of a Menu link, go to the Control Panel-&gt;Menus Menu-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Item Manager and edit the Menu Item. Select the <strong>Change Type</strong> button and choose the new style of Menu Item Type from the available list. Thereafter, alter the Details and Parameters to reconfigure the display for the new selection  as you require it.</p>\nThe improved Installer can be found under the Extensions Menu. With versions prior to Joomla! 1.5 you needed to select a specific Extension type when you wanted to install it and use the Installer associated with it,   with Joomla! 1.5 you just select the Extension you want to upload, and click on install. The Installer will do all the hard work for you.', '', -2, 3, 0, 28, '2008-08-10 23:16:20', 62, '', '2008-08-10 23:16:20', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 04:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 4, 'robots=\nauthor=');

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.\n<p>You indeed can change the Menu Item''s Type to whatever you want,   even after they have been created. </p><p>If,   for instance, you want to change the Blog Section of a Menu link, go to the Control Panel-&gt;Menus Menu-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Item Manager and edit the Menu Item. Select the <strong>Change Type</strong> button and choose the new style of Menu Item Type from the available list. Thereafter, alter the Details and Parameters to reconfigure the display for the new selection  as you require it.</p>\nThe improved Installer can be found under the Extensions Menu. With versions prior to Joomla! 1.5 you needed to select a specific Extension type when you wanted to install it and use the Installer associated with it,   with Joomla! 1.5 you just select the Extension you want to upload, and click on install. The Installer will do all the hard work for you.\n<p>Mambots have been renamed as Plugins. </p><p>Mambots were introduced in Mambo and offered possibilities to add plug-in logic to your site mainly for the purpose of manipulating content. In Joomla! 1.5,   Plugins will now have much broader capabilities than Mambots. Plugins are able to extend functionality at the framework layer as well.</p>', '', -2, 3, 0, 28, '2008-08-11 09:17:00', 62, '', '2008-08-11 09:17:00', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 10:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 4, 'robots=\nauthor=');

However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla!

All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.\n<p>You indeed can change the Menu Item''s Type to whatever you want,   even after they have been created. </p><p>If,   for instance, you want to change the Blog Section of a Menu link, go to the Control Panel-&gt;Menus Menu-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Item Manager and edit the Menu Item. Select the <strong>Change Type</strong> button and choose the new style of Menu Item Type from the available list. Thereafter, alter the Details and Parameters to reconfigure the display for the new selection  as you require it.</p>\nThe improved Installer can be found under the Extensions Menu. With versions prior to Joomla! 1.5 you needed to select a specific Extension type when you wanted to install it and use the Installer associated with it,   with Joomla! 1.5 you just select the Extension you want to upload, and click on install. The Installer will do all the hard work for you.\n<p>Mambots have been renamed as Plugins. </p><p>Mambots were introduced in Mambo and offered possibilities to add plug-in logic to your site mainly for the purpose of manipulating content. In Joomla! 1.5,   Plugins will now have much broader capabilities than Mambots. Plugins are able to extend functionality at the framework layer as well.</p>\n<p>A lot of different languages are available for the Back-end,   but by default this language may not be installed. If you want a translated Back-end, get your language pack and install it using the Extension Installer. After this, go to the Extensions Menu, select Language Manager and make your language the default one. Your Back-end will be translated immediately.</p><p>Users who have access rights to the Back-end may choose the language they prefer in their Personal Details parameters. This is of also true for the Front-end language.</p><p> A good place to find where to download your languages and localised versions of Joomla! is <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=listcats&cat_id=1837&Itemid=35" target="_blank" title="Translations for Joomla!">Translations for Joomla!</a> on JED.</p>', '', -2, 3, 0, 32, '2008-08-11 17:18:14', 62, '', '2008-08-11 17:18:14', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 14:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 7, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 7, 'robots=\nauthor=');

The new implementation is fully backward compatible.</p>\nNo you don''t. Versions of MySQL lower than 4.1 do not have built in UTF-8 support. However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more. The Documentation Team helps oversee the wiki but you are invited to contribute content, as well.</p> <p>There are also books written about Joomla!

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a>. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!</p><p>A useful guide to the Extension site can be found at:<br /><a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/" target="_blank" title="Guide to the Joomla! Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.\n<p>You indeed can change the Menu Item''s Type to whatever you want,   even after they have been created. </p><p>If,   for instance, you want to change the Blog Section of a Menu link, go to the Control Panel-&gt;Menus Menu-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Item Manager and edit the Menu Item. Select the <strong>Change Type</strong> button and choose the new style of Menu Item Type from the available list. Thereafter, alter the Details and Parameters to reconfigure the display for the new selection  as you require it.</p>\nThe improved Installer can be found under the Extensions Menu. With versions prior to Joomla! 1.5 you needed to select a specific Extension type when you wanted to install it and use the Installer associated with it,   with Joomla! 1.5 you just select the Extension you want to upload, and click on install. The Installer will do all the hard work for you.\n<p>Mambots have been renamed as Plugins. </p><p>Mambots were introduced in Mambo and offered possibilities to add plug-in logic to your site mainly for the purpose of manipulating content. In Joomla! 1.5,   Plugins will now have much broader capabilities than Mambots. Plugins are able to extend functionality at the framework layer as well.</p>\n<p>A lot of different languages are available for the Back-end,   but by default this language may not be installed. If you want a translated Back-end, get your language pack and install it using the Extension Installer. After this, go to the Extensions Menu, select Language Manager and make your language the default one. Your Back-end will be translated immediately.</p><p>Users who have access rights to the Back-end may choose the language they prefer in their Personal Details parameters. This is of also true for the Front-end language.</p><p> A good place to find where to download your languages and localised versions of Joomla! is <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=listcats&cat_id=1837&Itemid=35" target="_blank" title="Translations for Joomla!">Translations for Joomla!</a> on JED.</p>\n<p>To completely remove an Article,   select the Articles that you want to delete and move them to the Trash. Next,   open the Article Trash in the Content Menu and select the Articles you want to delete. After deleting an Article, it is no longer available as it has been deleted from the database and it is not possible to undo this operation.  </p>', '', -2, 3, 0, 27, '2008-08-11 09:19:01', 62, '', '2008-08-11 09:19:01', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 10:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 6, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 4, 'robots=\nauthor=');

However,   Joomla! 1.5 has made provisions for backward compatibility and is able to use UTF-8 on older databases. Let the installer take care of all the settings and there is no need to make any changes to the database (charset, collation, or any other).\n<h4><font color="#ff6600">Joomla! features:</font></h4> <ul><li>Completely database driven site engines </li><li>News,   products,   or services sections fully editable and manageable</li><li>Topics sections can be added to by contributing Authors </li><li>Fully customisable layouts including <em>left</em>, <em>center</em>, and <em>right </em>Menu boxes </li><li>Browser upload of images to your own library for use anywhere in the site </li><li>Dynamic Forum/Poll/Voting booth for on-the-spot results </li><li>Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX server, Solaris, and AIX\n<p>If you''re new to Web publishing systems,   you''ll find that Joomla! delivers sophisticated solutions to your online needs. It can deliver a robust enterprise-level Web site,   empowered by endless extensibility for your bespoke publishing needs. Moreover, it is often the system of choice for small business or home users who want a professional looking site that''s simple to deploy and use. <em>We do content right</em>.<br /> </p><p>So what''s the catch? How much does this system cost?</p><p> Well, there''s good news ... and more good news! Joomla! 1.5 is free, it is released under an Open Source license - the GNU/General Public License v 2.0. Had you invested in a mainstream, commercial alternative, there''d be nothing but moths left in your wallet and to add new functionality would probably mean taking out a second mortgage each time you wanted something adding!</p><p>Joomla! changes all that ... <br />Joomla! is different from the normal models for content management software. For a start, it''s not complicated. Joomla! has been developed for everybody, and anybody can develop it further. It is designed to work (primarily) with other Open Source, free, software such as PHP, MySQL, and Apache. </p><p>It is easy to install and administer, and is reliable. </p><p>Joomla! doesn''t even require the user or administrator of the system to know HTML to operate it once it''s up and running.</p><p>To get the perfect Web site with all the functionality that you require for your particular application may take additional time and effort, but with the Joomla! Community support that is available and the many Third Party Developers actively creating and releasing new Extensions for the 1.5 platform on an almost daily basis, there is likely to be something out there to meet your needs. Or you could develop your own Extensions and make these available to the rest of the community. </p>\n<h1>Support </h1><p>Support for the Joomla! CMS can be found on several places. The best place to start would be the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. Here you can help yourself to the information that is regularly published and updated as Joomla! develops. There is much more to come too!</p> <p>Of course you should not forget the Help System of the CMS itself. On the <em>topmenu </em>in the Back-end Control panel you find the Help button which will provide you with lots of explanation on features.</p> <p>Another great place would of course be the <a href="http://forum.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Forum">Forum</a> . On the Joomla! Forum you can find help and support from Community members as well as from Joomla! Core members and Working Group members. The forum contains a lot of information,   FAQ''s,   just about anything you are looking for in terms of support.</p> <p>Two other resources for Support are the <a href="http://developer.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Developer Site">Joomla! Developer Site</a> and the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla! Extensions Directory</a> (JED). The Joomla! Developer Site provides lots of technical information for the experienced Developer as well as those new to Joomla! and development work in general. The JED whilst not a support site in the strictest sense has many of the Extensions that you will need as you develop your own Web site.</p> <p>The Joomla! Developers and Bug Squad members are regularly posting their blog reports about several topics such as programming techniques and security issues.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Joomla! Documentation can of course be found on the <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki">Joomla! Official Documentation Wiki</a>. You can find information for beginners,   installation, upgrade, Frequently Asked Questions, developer topics, and a lot more.

To support the changing nature of the Internet and emerging Web technologies,   Joomla! required substantial restructuring of its core functionality and we also used this effort to simplify many challenges within the current user interface. Joomla! 1.5 has many new features.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal">Joomla! runs on any platform including Windows, <a href="http://buy-sildenafil-online.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">no rx</a>\r  most flavours of Linux,   several Unix versions, <a href="http://cialis-discount.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">link</a>\r  and the Apple OS/X platform.  Joomla! depends on PHP and the MySQL database to deliver dynamic content.  </p>            <p class="MsoNormal">The minimum requirements are:</p>      <ul><li>Apache 1.x, 2.x and higher</li><li>PHP 4.3 and higher</li><li>MySQL 3.23 and higher</li></ul>It will also run on alternative server platforms such as Windows IIS - provided they support PHP and MySQL - but these require additional configuration in order for the Joomla! core package to be successful installed and operated.\n<p>Joomla! provides plenty of flexibility when displaying your Web content. Whether you are using Joomla! for a blog site,   news or a Web site for a company,   you''ll find one or more content styles to showcase your information. You can also change the style of content dynamically depending on your preferences. Joomla! calls how a page is laid out a <strong>layout</strong>. Use the guide below to understand which layouts are available and how you might use them. </p> <h2>Content </h2> <p>Joomla! makes it extremely easy to add and display content. All content  is placed where your mainbody tag in your template is located. There are three main types of layouts available in Joomla! and all of them can be customised via parameters. The display and parameters are set in the Menu Item used to display the content your working on. You create these layouts by creating a Menu Item and choosing how you want the content to display.</p> <h3>Blog Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Blog layout will show a listing of all Articles of the selected blog type (Section or Category) in the mainbody position of your template. It will give you the standard title,   and Intro of each Article in that particular Category and/or Section. You can customise this layout via the use of the Preferences and Parameters, (See Article Parameters) this is done from the Menu not the Section Manager!</p> <h3>Blog Archive Layout<br /> </h3> <p>A Blog Archive layout will give you a similar output of Articles as the normal Blog Display but will add, at the top, two drop down lists for month and year plus a search button to allow Users to search for all Archived Articles from a specific month and year.</p> <h3>List Layout<br /> </h3> <p>Table layout will simply give you a <em>tabular </em>list<em> </em>of all the titles in that particular Section or Category. No Intro text will be displayed just the titles. You can set how many titles will be displayed in this table by Parameters. The table layout will also provide a filter Section so that Users can reorder, filter, and set how many titles are listed on a single page (up to 50)</p> <h2>Wrapper</h2> <p>Wrappers allow you to place stand alone applications and Third Party Web sites inside your Joomla! site. The content within a Wrapper appears within the primary content area defined by the "mainbody" tag and allows you to display their content as a part of your own site. A Wrapper will place an IFRAME into the content Section of your Web site and wrap your standard template navigation around it so it appears in the same way an Article would.</p> <h2>Content Parameters</h2> <p>The parameters for each layout type can be found on the right hand side of the editor boxes in the Menu Item configuration screen. The parameters available depend largely on what kind of layout you are configuring.</p>\n<p>Joomla! runs on the PHP pre-processor. PHP comes in many flavours,   for a lot of operating systems. Beside PHP you will need a Web server. Joomla! is optimized for the Apache Web server,   but it can run on different Web servers like Microsoft IIS it just requires additional configuration of PHP and MySQL. Joomla! also depends on a database, for this currently you can only use MySQL.</p>\n<p>Many people know from their own experience that it''s not easy to install an Apache Web server and it gets harder if you want to add MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP, WAMP, and MAMP are easy to install distributions containing Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl for the Windows, Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. These packages are for localhost installations on non-public servers only.<br />The minimum version requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apache 1.x or 2.x</li>\n<li>PHP 4.3 or up</li>\n<li>MySQL 3.23 or up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the latest minimum requirements details, see <a href="http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Technical Requirements">Joomla! Technical Requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box,   Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your Web site sing. But for many people,   the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for developers all around the world to create powerful add-ons that are called <strong>Extensions</strong>. An Extension is used to add capabilities to Joomla! that do not exist in the base core code. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available Extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Dynamic form builders</li>   <li>Business or organisational directories</li>   <li>Document management</li>   <li>Image and multimedia galleries</li>   <li>E-commerce and shopping cart engines</li>   <li>Forums and chat software</li>   <li>Calendars</li>   <li>E-mail newsletters</li>   <li>Data collection and reporting tools</li>   <li>Banner advertising systems</li>   <li>Paid subscription services</li>   <li>and many,   many, more</li> </ul> <p>You can find more examples over at our ever growing <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla!

Extension site">http://extensions.joomla.org/content/view/15/63/</a> </p> <h3>Types of Extensions </h3><p>There are five types of extensions:</p> <ul>   <li>Components</li>   <li>Modules</li>   <li>Templates</li>   <li>Plugins</li>   <li>Languages</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the specifics of these using the links in the Article Index - a Table of Contents (yet another useful feature of Joomla!) - at the top right or by clicking on the <strong>Next </strong>link below.<br /> </p> <hr title="Components" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_com.png" border="0" alt="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Component - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Components</h3> <p>A Component is the largest and most complex of the Extension types.  Components are like mini-applications that render the main body of the  page. An analogy that might make the relationship easier to understand  would be that Joomla! is a book and all the Components are chapters in  the book. The core Article Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_content</font>), for example, is the  mini-application that handles all core Article rendering just as the  core registration Component (<font face="courier new,courier">com_user</font>) is the mini-application  that handles User registration.</p> <p>Many of Joomla!''s core features are provided by the use of default Components such as:</p> <ul>   <li>Contacts</li>   <li>Front Page</li>   <li>News Feeds</li>   <li>Banners</li>   <li>Mass Mail</li>   <li>Polls</li></ul><p>A Component will manage data, set displays, provide functions, and in general can perform any operation that does not fall under the general functions of the core code.</p> <p>Components work hand in hand with Modules and Plugins to provide a rich variety of content display and functionality aside from the standard Article and content display. They make it possible to completely transform Joomla! and greatly expand its capabilities.</p>  <hr title="Modules" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_mod.png" border="0" alt="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Module - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Modules</h3> <p>A more lightweight and flexible Extension used for page rendering is a Module. Modules are used for small bits of the page that are generally  less complex and able to be seen across different Components. To  continue in our book analogy, a Module can be looked at as a footnote  or header block, or perhaps an image/caption block that can be rendered  on a particular page. Obviously you can have a footnote on any page but  not all pages will have them. Footnotes also might appear regardless of  which chapter you are reading. Simlarly Modules can be rendered  regardless of which Component you have loaded.</p> <p>Modules are like little mini-applets that can be placed anywhere on your site. They work in conjunction with Components in some cases and in others are complete stand alone snippets of code used to display some data from the database such as Articles (Newsflash) Modules are usually used to output data but they can also be interactive form items to input data for example the Login Module or Polls.</p> <p>Modules can be assigned to Module positions which are defined in your Template and in the back-end using the Module Manager and editing the Module Position settings. For example, "left" and "right" are common for a 3 column layout. </p> <h4>Displaying Modules</h4> <p>Each Module is assigned to a Module position on your site. If you wish it to display in two different locations you must copy the Module and assign the copy to display at the new location. You can also set which Menu Items (and thus pages) a Module will display on, you can select all Menu Items or you can pick and choose by holding down the control key and selecting multiple locations one by one in the Modules [Edit] screen</p> <p>Note: Your Main Menu is a Module! When you create a new Menu in the Menu Manager you are actually copying the Main Menu Module (<font face="courier new,courier">mod_mainmenu</font>) code and giving it the name of your new Menu. When you copy a Module you do not copy all of its parameters, you simply allow Joomla! to use the same code with two separate settings.</p> <h4>Newsflash Example</h4> <p>Newsflash is a Module which will display Articles from your site in an assignable Module position. It can be used and configured to display one Category, all Categories, or to randomly choose Articles to highlight to Users. It will display as much of an Article as you set, and will show a <em>Read more...</em> link to take the User to the full Article.</p> <p>The Newsflash Component is particularly useful for things like Site News or to show the latest Article added to your Web site.</p>  <hr title="Plugins" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_plugin.png" border="0" alt="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" title="Plugin - Joomla! Extension Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Plugins</h3> <p>One  of the more advanced Extensions for Joomla! is the Plugin. In previous  versions of Joomla! Plugins were known as Mambots. Aside from changing their name their  functionality has been expanded. A Plugin is a section of code that  runs when a pre-defined event happens within Joomla!. Editors are Plugins, for example, that execute when the Joomla! event <font face="courier new,courier">onGetEditorArea</font> occurs. Using a Plugin allows a developer to change  the way their code behaves depending upon which Plugins are installed  to react to an event.</p>  <hr title="Languages" class="system-pagebreak" /> <h3><img src="images/stories/ext_lang.png" border="0" alt="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" title="Language - Joomla! Extensions Directory" width="17" height="17" /> Languages</h3> <p>New  to Joomla! 1.5 and perhaps the most basic and critical Extension is a Language. Joomla! is released with multiple Installation Languages but the base Site and Administrator are packaged in just the one Language <strong>en-GB</strong> - being English with GB spelling for example. To include all the translations currently available would bloat the core package and make it unmanageable for uploading purposes. The Language files enable all the User interfaces both Front-end and Back-end to be presented in the local preferred language. Note these packs do not have any impact on the actual content such as Articles. </p> <p>More information on languages is available from the <br />   <a href="http://community.joomla.org/translations.html" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Translation Teams">http://community.joomla.org/translations.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>Got a question? </strong>With more than 210,  000 members,   the Joomla!

We assume you have set-up your Web site,   and it is accessible with your browser.<br /><br />Download Joomla! 1.5, unzip it and upload/copy the files into the directory you Web site points to, fire up your browser and enter your Web site address and the installation will start.  </p><p>For full details on the installation processes check out the <a href="http://help.joomla.org/content/category/48/268/302" target="_blank" title="Joomla! 1.5 Installation Manual">Installation Manual</a> on the <a href="http://help.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Help Site">Joomla! Help Site</a> where you will also find download instructions for a PDF version too. </p>\nThe collation option determines the way ordering in the database is done. In languages that use special characters,   for instance the German umlaut,   the database collation determines the sorting order. If you don''t know which collation you need,   select the "utf8_general_ci" as most languages use this. The other collations listed are exceptions in regards to the general collation. If your language is not listed in the list of collations it most likely means that "utf8_general_ci is suitable.\nWithin the Installer you will find a wide collection of languages. The installer currently supports the following languages: Arabic,   Bulgarian,   Bengali, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Devanagari(India), Croatian(Croatia), Magyar (Hungary), Italian, Malay, Norwegian bokmal, Dutch, Portuguese(Brasil), Portugues(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Svenska, Thai and more are being added all the time.<br />By default the English language is installed for the Back and Front-ends. You can download additional language files from the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org" target="_blank" title="Joomla! Extensions Directory">Joomla!Extensions Directory</a>.\nWell you are reading it right now! This depends on what you want to achieve. If you are new to Joomla! and have no clue how it all fits together,   just install the sample data. If you don''t like the English sample data because you - for instance - speak Chinese, then leave it out.\n<p>In Joomla! versions prior to 1.5 there were separate processes for creating a Static Content Item and normal Content Items. The processes have been combined now and whilst both content types are still around they are renamed as Articles for Content Items and Uncategorized Articles for Static Content Items. </p><p>If you want to create a static item,   create a new Article in the same way as for standard content and rather than relating this to a particular Section and Category just select <span style="font-style: italic">Uncategorized</span> as the option in the Section and Category drop down lists.</p>\nMost Articles will be assigned to a Section and Category. In many cases,   you might not know where you want it to appear so put the Article in the <em>Uncategorized </em>Section/Category. The Articles marked as <em>Uncategorized </em>are handled as static content.\nYes! Prior to Joomla! 1.5,   only the text values of an Article and only for ISO-8859-1 encoding was allowed in the PDF rendition. With the new PDF library in place,   the complete Article including images is rendered and applied to the PDF. The PDF generator also handles the UTF-8 texts and can handle any character sets from any language. The appropriate fonts must be installed but this is done automatically during a language pack installation.\n<p>You indeed can change the Menu Item''s Type to whatever you want,   even after they have been created. </p><p>If,   for instance, you want to change the Blog Section of a Menu link, go to the Control Panel-&gt;Menus Menu-&gt;[menuname]-&gt;Menu Item Manager and edit the Menu Item. Select the <strong>Change Type</strong> button and choose the new style of Menu Item Type from the available list. Thereafter, alter the Details and Parameters to reconfigure the display for the new selection  as you require it.</p>\nThe improved Installer can be found under the Extensions Menu. With versions prior to Joomla! 1.5 you needed to select a specific Extension type when you wanted to install it and use the Installer associated with it,   with Joomla! 1.5 you just select the Extension you want to upload, and click on install. The Installer will do all the hard work for you.\n<p>Mambots have been renamed as Plugins. </p><p>Mambots were introduced in Mambo and offered possibilities to add plug-in logic to your site mainly for the purpose of manipulating content. In Joomla! 1.5,   Plugins will now have much broader capabilities than Mambots. Plugins are able to extend functionality at the framework layer as well.</p>\n<p>A lot of different languages are available for the Back-end,   but by default this language may not be installed. If you want a translated Back-end, get your language pack and install it using the Extension Installer. After this, go to the Extensions Menu, select Language Manager and make your language the default one. Your Back-end will be translated immediately.</p><p>Users who have access rights to the Back-end may choose the language they prefer in their Personal Details parameters. This is of also true for the Front-end language.</p><p> A good place to find where to download your languages and localised versions of Joomla! is <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=listcats&cat_id=1837&Itemid=35" target="_blank" title="Translations for Joomla!">Translations for Joomla!</a> on JED.</p>\n<p>To completely remove an Article,   select the Articles that you want to delete and move them to the Trash. Next,   open the Article Trash in the Content Menu and select the Articles you want to delete. After deleting an Article, it is no longer available as it has been deleted from the database and it is not possible to undo this operation.  </p>\n<p>When you <em>Archive </em>an Article, <a href="http://cheap-cialis-pills.net" style="text-decoration:none;color:#676c6c">view</a>\r  the content is put into a state which removes it from your site as published content. The Article is still available from within the Control Panel and can be <em>retrieved </em>for editing or republishing purposes. Trashed Articles are just one step from being permanently deleted but are still available until you Remove them from the Trash Manager. You should use Archive if you consider an Article important,   but not current. Trash should be used when you want to delete the content entirely from your site and from future search results.  </p>', '', -2, 3, 0, 27, '2008-08-11 05:19:43', 62, '', '2008-08-11 05:19:43', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2006-10-10 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 8, 0, 0, '', '', 0, 5, 'robots=\nauthor=');

After a few seconds take a look at the consistency and add more olive oil until you get it to the right moistness. Taste to determine if it''s salty/peppery/hot enough for you.

Stir and let simmer while the brats continue to cook. While the brats are cooking deseed the tomato and dice it up. Crumble the queso fresco. Add the remaining onions, cheese and tomato to a large bowl so that you can garnish the brats at the end. Once the brats are done, remove them and the pot from the grill. Put the buns on the grill and let the toast. Pull everything off and assemble. Brat on bun, black bean chili on the brat, then garnish with tomato, onion and cheese.

Here are just a few reasons why:<br /><br />A woman over 40 will never wake you in the middle of the night and ask, "What are you thinking?" She doesn''t care what you think. If a woman over 40 doesn''t want to watch the game, she doesn''t sit around whining about it. She does something s he wants to do, and it''s usually more interesting. Women over 40 are dignified. They seldom have a screaming match with you at the opera or in the middle of an expensive restaurant. Of course, if you d eserve it, they won''t hesitate to shoot you if they think they can get away with it.. Older women are generous with praise, often undeserved. They know what it''s like to be unappreciated. Women get psychic as they age. You never have to confess your sins to a woman over 40. Once you get past a wrinkle or two, a woman over 40 is far sexier than her younger counterpart. Older women are forthright and honest. They''ll tell you right off if you are a jerk if you are acting like one. You don''t ever have to wonder where you stand with her. Yes, we praise women over 40 for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, it''s not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coiffed, hot woman over 40, there is a bald, paunchy relic in yellow pants making a fool of himself with some 22-year old waitress .. Ladies, I apologize. For all those men who say, "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?", here''s an update for you. Nowadays 80% of women are against marriage. Why? Because women realize it''s not worth buying an entire pig just to get a little sausage! </span></p>', '', 0, 0, 0, 0, '2011-01-02 13:17:05', 62, '', '2018-04-17 00:11:07', 62, 62, '2018-04-17 00:11:12', '2011-01-02 13:16:36', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 5, 0, 15, '', '', 0, 129, 'robots=\nauthor=');

Second, we will discuss an actual example. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>To walk through the example, you need to understand that 3.5e used the concept of “Challenge Ratings” or CRs to denote difficulty of encounters. 4e uses “Encounter Levels” or ELs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The first graphic below shows examples of how it was done in 3.5e, the second in 4e:</span></span></span><span style="mso-no-proof: yes;"> </span></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><img src="images/cr.gif" border="0" alt="3e targe crs" /></span></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><img src="images/targetxp.gif" border="0" /></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000;">What you will notice about 3.5e is that there is a sliding scale for XP rewards based on the level of the PCs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>That is, a 5<sup>th</sup> level player character (PC) would get 1,000 XP for defeating a monster with a CR of 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>A PC of level 10 would only get 375.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>That concept does not exist in 4e, but is important to keep in mind when doing the conversion. </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000;">Next, let’s take a look at the XPs required for each level based on each version.

Using our 10% of the total experience for a level per encounter, we would calculate that a standard 5 PC group should gain about 2,500 XP per encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>We’ll keep this in mind. </span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span

6<sup>th</sup> level in 4e.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>With 5 PCs, that means they have to gain 10,000 XP so that everyone can level up after 10 encounters.<span style="mso-spacerun:

thing to notice is that the ratio at 5<sup>th</sup> level for 3.5e to 4e is about 5:2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>For 6<sup>th</sup> level it is 12:5 and for 12<sup>th</sup> level it is

</span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;">Enough about the fundamentals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Let’s do an actual conversion using my method below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The example is for “The Eyes of the Lich Queen” a 3.5e 5<sup>th – </sup>9<sup>th</sup> level adventure. </span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;">The first encounter has 2 monsters of level CR2, and one monster of CR4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Using our chart, this would equate to: (2 * 500 XP) + (1 * 1,000 XP) = 2,000 XP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>As we calculated before an average difficulty encounter for 3.5e at 5<sup>th</sup> level is 2,500 XP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Thus this first encounter is a little on the easy side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Now that we have that parameter, let’s calculate how many XP we will need in 4e to make an equivalent difficulty encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Since the ratio we calculated for 3.5e to 4e at 5<sup>th</sup> level was 5:2, the amount of experience we need to have in 4e is: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>2,000 * 2 / 5 = 800 XP (once again, the 10% rule of thumb let us know that 1,000 XP is an average difficulty for 4e, so 800 XP is a little easy).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Ok, now that the math is over, let’s find some monsters to fill up our 800 XP budget.</span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;">Since these are lizardfolk and lizardfolk are in both editions, let’s find the right type of 4e lizardfolk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I chose 2 Greenscale Darters (200 XP each) and 1 Blackscale Bruiser (250 XP) to start with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>That’s 750 XP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I still can make this “easy” encounter a little more challenging and not totally blow the budget if I add some minions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p

style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: "><span style="color: #000000;">Because a Greenscale Darter is a 5<sup>th</sup> level monster, a Greenscale Darter minion would be worth 50 XP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I could pick one of these to flesh out the encounter and be at 800 XP exactly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>However, who ever has just one minion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I’ll pick 2, and raise the encounter’s total XP worth to 850 XP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>This encounter should be pretty close to the difficulty of the 3.5e encounter assuming the characters are 5<sup>th</sup> level and there are 5 of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Pretty simple, huh?</span></span></p>\r\n<p

encounter, because I thought it was way too difficult if one of the monsters broke out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I have two options: have the other monsters not free the caged one and let the characters decide whether to leave it in its cage, free it, or kill it; or I could have one of the monsters open the cage at the beginning of battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I’ve decided that I wanted to free the monster and make the battle a little more interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>So let’s count up all that 3.5e experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>There are 4 CR3s and 1 CR6 in this encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Running the numbers that’s: (4 * 750 XP) + (1 * 2,250 XP) = 5,250 XP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Holy moley!!

If you cover the rice the entire time, the rice will still be plenty hot once the main dish is ready.</p>\n<p style="font-family: ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: #000000; "><br style="font-family: ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; " /></p>\n<p style="font-family: ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; color: #000000; ">Note: If you don''t want to have  tacos, you can easily change this into an appetizer.  You will need <strong style="font-family: ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px; ">large</strong> portabellas caps instead of mediums.  You will also need only one sauasge per 2 portabella caps.

INSERT INTO `jos_content` VALUES(89, 'Powerline AV Network at home', 'powerline-av-network-at-home', '', '<p><span style="line-height: normal;">I finally decided to upgrade my home network and thought I would share my setup. Here were my requirements:</span></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">1. Ability to stream HD video</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">2. Ability to stream my entire music collection in wav,   flac, mp3, aac, etc. formats</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">3. Access to netflix, hulu, amazon, etc.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">So here is what I ended up with:</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">To be able to stream HD video I went with powerline adapters. Since my house is not wired for ethernet and because I felt wireless-N would be pushing the limits, I decided on this product:</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F537KC/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01" target="_blank" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F537KC/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F537KC/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01</a></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">I bought 3 packs of the above for a total of 6 adapters. I configured them thusly:</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">1. Adapter in basement plugged into wireless router. Wireless router has a server, cable modem, 2 TB external disk and printer attached to it. Server is ubuntu 12.10 and is a 6 to 8 year old gateway desktop. Router is a dual-band gigabit ethernet / 900 Mbps wireless: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KG44V0/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00" target="_blank" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KG44V0/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KG44V0/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 </a></p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The 2 TB disk is a backup of the disk attached to the ubuntu server. Since my server is so old and only 10/100 Mpbs, I wanted to have the streaming of media come directly from the router. The server itself pretty much just sits there and serves up my music collection via subsonic(www.subsonic.org) and runs vuze and hosts a bevy of external disk drives.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">2. Adapter in the den on the first floor is plugged into the Tivo</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">3. Adapter in the second floor office is plugged into a windows box which shares a couple of printers as well as grabs video off the tivo boxes and converts them to other formats</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">4. Adapter in my daughter''s room connected to her Wii.</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">5. Adapter in the master bedroom connected to a Tivo and Blu-Ray (these devices are also 10/100 Mbps--that''s why I also have adapter #6 below)</p>\n<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">6. Adapter in the master bedroom connected to Western Digital 1 TB WD TV Live Hub Media Center. This device is the coup de gras in my system. Can play just about any media type found on any shared drive in the house (whether the device is on my basement server, connected to the router, or on the office windows box). What I realllly love about the device is how well it can play various file types. In fact, I think that I get best results from iso files. I.e., I''ve been taking the DVDs I''ve downloaded from here and converting them to iso images. It''s the same quality and less fuss than actually burning DVD copies.

Under <a href="http://www.playonlinux.com/en/" target="_blank" title="play on linux">play on linux</a>, go to the install button</p>\n<p>2. Choose "install an unlisted program"</p>\n<p><img src="images/0.png" border="0" width="802" height="579" /></p>\n<p>3. Click "next" on the manual installation page and then chose "Install a program in a new virtual drive"</p>\n<p>4. Name the install (e.g., OED4)</p>\n<p><img src="images/manual-installation.png" border="0" width="522" height="427" /></p>\n<p>5. Click "Configure wine"</p>\n<p><img src="images/configure-wine.png" border="0" width="522" height="427" /></p>\n<p>6. Choose "32 bit installation" and click "Next"</p>\n<p>7. Once the Wine Configuration screen launches, choose Windows 7</p>\n<p><img src="images/win-7.png" border="0" width="412" height="475" /></p>\n<p>8. Click on the "Drives" tab. At this point (assuming you have placed your OED 4.0 install disc in the CD-ROM drive, you will see a mapping to that drive:</p>\n<p><img src="images/install-only.png" border="0" width="412" height="475" /></p>\n<p>The install will not go forward properly when you are asked to insert you previous version''s data disk.  At this point, do the following: eject the install disk, insert you previous version''s data disk, and add an additional drive for the data disk. Alternatively, you could just start the wine install process with the previous version''s data disk in the drive. The key element here is that there is a drive mapping explicitly for the previous version. As long as you have that mapping, the install will work. Here is an image of what my list of drives looks like at this point:</p>\n<p><img src="images/data-only.png" border="0" width="412" height="475" /></p>\n<p>click the "OK" button to continue</p>\n<p>9. On the next screen click the browse button</p>\n<p><img src="images/browse-2.png" border="0" width="522" height="427" /></p>\n<p>10. Eject your data disk and insert the Version 4 OED Install disk. Note--you may have to eject one more time and insert the install disk one more time.  It appears that you have to do this because wine has a little trouble realizing that a new CD was mounted.  If you have an external CD drive, the easiest thing to do is to just disconnect the USB cable and reconnect. Navigate to the install.exe program on the CD-ROM and click "OPEN".</p>\n<p><img src="images/install-exe.png" border="0" width="854" height="744" /></p>\n<p>11. Click "NEXT" when back at the Manual Installation wizard screen:</p>\n<p><img src="images/start-install.png" border="0" width="522" height="427" /></p>\n<p>12. At this point you will be asked to insert your previous data disk.  Eject the install disk and insert the data disk from your previous version at this time.  Once again, make sure that it mounts properly before proceeding.  Execute the double insert-eject trick again if needed (or disconnect and reconnect the USB cable if the drive is external).  At this point, click the "OK" button:</p>\n<p><img src="images/insert-old.png" border="0" width="370" height="217" /></p>\n<p>Note: on my system, I know the mounting of the next disc is successful once a windows opens to show it:</p>\n<p><img src="images/old-data.png" border="0" width="802" height="579" /></p>\n<p>13. If you see the screen below, you''re well on your way to a successful install:</p>\n<p><img src="images/success-data.png" border="0" width="370" height="217" /></p>\n<p>14. Once again, eject the data disk and insert the install disk, ensuring that it is fully mounted using the disc change procedures mentioned above. On my system, I see that the disc can be recognized when the window opens:</p>\n<p><img src="images/install-disc.png" border="0" width="802" height="579" /></p>\n<p>15. Next the windows install screen will appear:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="images/windows-install.png" border="0" width="1301" height="744" /></p>\n<p>16. Proceed with the install accepting the defaults.  After a minute or so, you will be asked to insert the OED 4.0 data disc.  Follow the aforementioned procedures to make sure it mounts properly and click "OK"</p>\n<p><img src="images/windows-data.png" border="0" width="1301" height="744" /></p>\n<p>Note, when my data disc is properly mounted, I see the following:</p>\n<p><img src="images/data-disc-4.png" border="0" width="802" height="579" /></p>\n<p>17. After the data disc has finished copying it''s files, you will see the following:</p>\n<p><img src="images/complete.png" border="0" width="433" height="376" /></p>\n<p>Click the "Exit" button.</p>\n<p>18. Note that the original "insert previous version''s data disc" dialog is still open:</p>\n<p><img src="images/success-data.png" border="0" width="370" height="217" /></p>\n<p>Click the "Cancel" button as directed.</p>\n<p>19. Next select an icon:</p>\n<p><img src="images/icon.png" border="0" width="522" height="427" /></p>\n<p>Click "Next" and then give your program a name:</p>\n<p><img src="images/OED4.png" border="0" width="522" height="427" /></p>\n<p>Click "Next".  On the following screen, select "i don''t want to make another shortcut" and click "Next"</p>\n<p>20. <span style="line-height: 1.3em;">At this point, eject the data disc and re-insert the install disk following the aforementioned procedures.  I believe that this is required for the first time you run the dictionary program.  After the first time, the disc will not need to be mounted.  Note, if you do not have the right disc installed, you will get the following message:</span></p>\n<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;"><img src="images/wrong-disc.png" border="0" width="469" height="221" /></span></p>\n<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">If you get the above screen, just get the right disc mounted and click "Retry".</span></p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">At this point, you can now launch the dictionary.

The performance can be found on the album <em>Ellington at Newport</em>. The concert was very important as it is credited as revitalizing the big band leaders'' diminishing career. George Wein described the concert as "the greatest performance of [Ellington''s] career... It stood for everything that jazz had been and could be." </span><span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">The concert is also featured in the Ken Burns'' Jazz documentary (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNBpMRPfw0A" target="_blank" style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">link</a><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">Specifically, the song featured in Burn''s documentary was "</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; color: #37404e;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">Diminuendo In Blue and Crescendo In Blue".  The reason is because this is probably the song that saved Duke''s career. The song</span></span><span style="color: #37404e; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, ''lucida grande'', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"> features a very long solo by Gonsalves — with Ellington yelling "Come on, Paul — dig in! Dig in!". The crowd, which had been filing out of the festival, quickly turned around and came back in. Some ended up dancing in the aisles--possibly due to the platinum blonde woman in a black evening dress (Elaine Anderson) getting up and dancing enthusiastically. When the solo ended, Gonsalves collapsed in exhaustion, but Ellington took over for two choruses before the full band returned for the "Crescendo in Blue" portion of the song.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #37404e;

Joining Mary on the album were Buster Williams on bass and Mickey Rocker on the drums. Although Mary recorded over 100 records in her career, this was only the ninth that she recorded as a leader.</p>\r\n<p>Mary was born Mary Elfrieda Scruggs in Atlanta, GA, but grew up in Pittsburgh, PA. She taught herself to play the piano and made her first public performance at six years old. She started playing professionally with Duke Ellington at the age of 12, and once at the ripe old age of 15, Louis Armstrong heard her playing in Harlem, and after the song he went up to her, picked her up and gave her a kiss. At 17, she married saxophonist John Williams and moved to Memphis, TN. In 1942, divorced from her husband, she returned to Pittsburgh for a while before moving to Europe for two years in 1952. In 1956 she became a Roman Catholic, quit performing and dedicated her time to the Bel Canto Foundation which helped musicians with drug addictions quit and return to performing. However, two priests and Duke Ellington convinced her to start performing again...and that brings you up with her history leading into yesterday''s profiled album, <em>Ellington at Newport</em>. <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>\r\n<p>Some of the awards and honors she received over her career were the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Guggenheim Fellowships in both 1972 and 1977</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Nominee in the 1971 Grammy''s for Best Jazz Performance - Group</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Founded the Mary Lou Williams Foundation in 1980</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Duke University''s Duke''s Trinity Award for service to the university in 1981; in 1983 Duke established the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">In 1996, The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. established the annual Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz Festival</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Another interesting bit of trivia for this day...it''s the day I published my last blog post for <strong>On this day in jazz</strong>. I started a year ago, profiling Miles Davis and Charles Mingus'' <em>Blue Moods</em>. While I admit the first few points left something to be desired, I think that I hit my stride by the end of the first month.

Instead of rescuing him, the people inside the car pushed him back out onto the street, where the chase by his attackers continued, and subsequently he was beaten to the point that his teeth, never in good condition to begin with, were knocked out, leaving him without the ability to play his horn. He took odd jobs, among them pumping gas. Meanwhile he was fitted for dentures and worked on his embouchure.

Along with Clifford and Max, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-morrow-mn0000654031/biography" target="_blank">George Morrow</a> (bass), <a href="http://www.haroldland.net/" target="_blank">Harold Land</a> (tenor sax) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Powell" target="_blank">Richie Powell</a> (drums) also appear on this work.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Joy Spring", mentioned above, was written by Clifford for his wife, whom he referred to as "Joy Spring". An interesting story about the couple: she was introduced to Clifford (by Max) while she was working on a student thesis that "jazz was inferior to her field of classical music". Clifford and her somehow got past this and were married. </span></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Unlike many of his contemporaries, Brown did not use drugs and was somewhat </span>abstemious<span style="line-height: 1.3em;"> with alcohol.

Brown and Richie Powell were being driven to Chicago late one night when Powell''s wife lost control of the car during a torrential rainstorm on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and all three lost their lives. A very tragic story and a great loss for jazz music. In memory of Clifford, Benny Golson wrote "I Remember Clifford", which has also become a jazz standard.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Brown''s influence lives on through the Clifford Brown Jazz Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization founded by his widow, LaRue Brown Watson. The mission of the foundation is to inspire a love for jazz among young people.

He was born in Fort Lauderdale, FL, but raised from an early age in Philadelphia, PA. Although he studied piano, flute and alto sax, he settled on tenor sax as his instrument of choice. He also studied drama at Goddard College from 1955 to 1959 but quickly decided to make a career in music.

While back in the US, the FBI went to his apartment to ask why he would do such a thing. He stated simply that he didn''t agree with the Portuguese government. In 2006, he gave an interview and discussed the events stating that:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I later learned that they put it into the school books of the schools in Portugal, what I did. And there was a revolution in 1974 of the young enlisted officers, and they overthrew Caetano. He fled the country.

Rollins understands the MJQ''s use of tension and dynamics beautifully. His big, warm tone above Lewis and Jackson on the former is sweet, relaxed, and in-the-pocket. On the latter, the knotty melodic frame is played a little slower, but is a tough fingerpopper nonetheless, with Rollins playing accents in the opening vamps and the just gliding into his big bluesy solo. This is a welcome addition to volume one, and a larger study in contrasts given Rollins propensity to really blow, as opposed Giuffre''s lower key approach on the first volume. To say that this set works is an understatement.

He couldn''t read music, but composed many songs including the standard, "Misty". He was short in stature (5''2") and would sit on multiple telephone directories while playing. As you might expect, he also had small hands that could barely span an octave, but could move them very quickly. C. Michael Bailey  said that due to having  no formal training,  "Garner was not encumbered by theory or common performance practice, thereby making his music quite uncommon." Of the album itself, <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/erroll-garner-concert-by-the-sea-by-c-michael-bailey.php#.VAxuT2BdU8o" target="_blank">Bailey says</a>:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Concert By The Sea is a flawed monument of perfection.

Also, even though Oscar recorded the album just a year after Miles, the sound is definitely OP--so you definitely get a totally different feel than you get with Davis''. Personally, I''m looking forward to seeing "Porgy & Bess" performed by the <a href="http://www.lyricopera.org/porgy/" target="_blank">Chicago Symphony Opera this November</a>.</p>\n<p>A little about OP: Oscar was born in the West Indies, but moved to Montreal as a young child.

The recording was made by Voice of America and later made its way to the vaults of the Library of Congress. It sat there gathering dust for over 45 years when recording supervisor Larry Applebaum noticed a set of tapes which were labeled “sp. Event 11/29/57 carnegie jazz concert (#1),” and one labeled “T. Monk.” . The album was released in 2005 after being restored by producer Michael Cuscuna and Monk''s son, T.S. Monk. After release it became the #1 selling album on amazon.com, and Newsweek even called it the "musical equivalent of the discovery of a new Mount Everest".

Also, it was the first "Jazz Messengers" album, and Art Blakey would use this name for the name of his band for the rest of his career. allmusic.com gives it its highest five star rating.</p>\n<p>Here''s Horace and the Jazz Messengers with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu4o65SwUIw" target="_blank">Doodlin</a>''":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu4o65SwUIw" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/6c1985cd3f9bb62c514601e3b269e.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Room 608" – 5:22</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Creepin'' In" – 7:26</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Stop Time" – 4:07</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"To Whom It May Concern" – 5:11</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Hippy" – 5:23</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"The Preacher" – 4:18</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Hankerin''" (Mobley) – 5:18</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Doodlin''" – 6:45</span></li>\n</ol>', '', 1, 8, 0, 58, '2014-12-02 22:22:03', 62, '', '2016-08-20 00:18:54', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-12-13 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 5, 0, 19, 'jazz, Horace Silver', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 1756, '');

R. Monterose, strings from <a href="http://mingusmingusmingus.com/" target="_blank">Charles Mingus</a> (credited as "Charlie" on the album cover), and drums by Jerry Segal.

"Flea Flop" was named "for the first notes of the melody, which seemed to suggest a jumping flea. This is also dedicated to the hotels and motels that jazz sidemen are obliged to stay in all over the country." The composition "Yokada Yokada" was named after the song "Yakety Yak", referring to "senseless dialogue between people," whilst "Alfred" was, of course, dedicated to producer Alfred Lion because of his "natural understanding of jazz in general," and because of the rapport that was established in the interpretation of Hill''s tunes. The title track "Judgment" was inspired by a poem written by Hill''s wife, Lavern. Ultimately, "Reconciliation" wants to represent "the adjustment every musician has to make to achieve unity and harmony with the rest of the group."</p>\n<p>Here''s Andrew with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb3sivDtZLI" target="_blank">Judgement!</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb3sivDtZLI" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/andrew-hill.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Siete Ocho" - 8:58</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Flea Flop" - 7:21</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Yokada Yokada" - 5:17</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Alfred" - 7:04</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Judgment" - 6:53</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Reconciliation" - 7:24</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Yokada Yokada" [alternate take] - 5:12 Bonus track on CD</span></li>\n</ol>', '', 1, 8, 0, 59, '2014-12-28 17:39:29', 62, '', '2016-08-16 21:53:32', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-01-08 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 4, 0, 24, 'jazz, Andrew Hill', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 1822, '');

The title of the work is <em>The Köln Concert</em> (Köln being the German word for the English Cologne). The album is a solo concert given by Keith late on January 24th after the opera had completed. This work is currently the best-selling solo album and the all-time best-selling piano album in jazz history (with more than 3.5 million units sold). Once you listen to the work,   you''ll understand why it sits at the top.</p>\n<p>A little bit about the performance: the concert was organized by a 17 year old who convinced both the opera house to have the concert and for Keith to play at it. When Keith got to the opera house for rehearsal,   the requested piano was not available and after seeing in what poor condition the piano was in, he almost cancelled the concert. Luckily for us, several hours of tuning made it playable and the concert was on. The album consists of essentially one song in four movements, and all of the music was improvised on the spot by Keith. No music had ever been written down and after the concert was heard by the masses, he was urged to publish the music for the work. Keith refused saying that it was improvised "on a certain night and should go as quickly as it comes." He finally submitted to the requests, but asked that any pianist only use it as a guide and not to play it note for note.

Perhaps his unique Post Bop style stemmed from his origins as a “Chicago tenor,” a tradition firmly rooted in the conventions of Swing and Bop harmony. Or perhaps it’s the result of his big, warm tone, which always made his abstract, meandering improvisational flights accessible and appealing. Whatever the cause, many musicians admired the effect, and Jordan was popular among the jazz community in the 1960s. Between 1960 and 1975, he recorded several acclaimed albums as a leader, backed by pianist Cedar Walton and a rotating rhythm section...</p>\n<p style="line-height: 15.8079996109009px;">In addition to the two songs mentioned above, also take a listen to this one, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEwRMYo2Xfw" target="_blank">He''s a Hero</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEwRMYo2Xfw" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/clifford-jordan.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">Track listing (songs by Clifford unless otherwise noted):</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"He''s a Hero" - 5:19</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Quasimodo" (Charlie Parker) - 7:08</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"No More" (Tutti Camarata, Bob Russell) - 4:54</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Blues for Muse" - 5:06</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"Adventurer" - 6:49</span></li>\n<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">"I''ll Be Around" (Alec Wilder) - 5:55</span></li>\n</ol>', '', 1, 8, 0, 60, '2015-01-24 19:41:29', 62, '', '2016-08-17 17:37:40', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-02-09 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 2, 0, 21, 'on this day in jazz, Clifford Jordan', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 1681, '');

I''ve been trying for a long time to work on swinging, and of all the albums I''ve done, this to me swings the most. [...] What''s different in <em>Speak Like a Child</em> as a whole has to do, first, with harmony. For the most part, the harmonies in these numbers are freer in the sense that they''re not so easily identifiable chordally in the conventional way. I''m more concerned with sounds than chords, and so I voice the harmonies to provide a wider spectrum of colors that can be contained within the traditional chord progression. [...] Similarly, in those tracks with the horns, I was more interested in sounds than in definite chord patterns. I tried to give the horns notes that would give color and body to the sounds I heard as I wrote.</p>\n<p>Here''s Herbie with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTNLWi-xAkE" target="_blank">Speak Like a Child</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTNLWi-xAkE" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/Herbie_Hancock_-_Speak_Like_a_Child.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Riot" – 4:40</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Speak Like a Child" – 7:50</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"First Trip" (Ron Carter) – 6:01</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Toys" – 5:52</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Goodbye to Childhood" – 7:06</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The Sorcerer" – 5:36</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 61, '2015-02-25 00:45:56', 62, '', '2016-08-17 17:48:06', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-03-06 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 2, 0, 26, 'on this day in jazz, Herbie Hancock', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 1612, '');

Ray had significant drug issues in the sixties and would only record a handful of albums as a leader; some will argue that he is owed the credit for creating the jazz fusion genre--having predated Miles Davis'' <em>Bitches Brew</em> by a couple of years with his band in the late sixties. The band, after its first performance at Hollywood''s Whisky a Go Go, was offered several record deals and booked at rock venues for the rest of the year, even opening for Jimi Hendrix and Jethro Tull.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Ray would turn back to heroin and would only record another couple of times in his lifetime. In 1982, at the age of 42, he was held up by several minors. He gave them his money, but they shot him anyway. He had been clean of drug use at the time of the attack and had an unfinished composition in his attache at the time of his death.

What you get are cool west coast interpretations of classic tunes with modern arrangements with a hint of the 1920s. The great reviewer Scott Yanow suggests getting the reissue version which features a few extra takes of the some of the songs (e.g. "Sweet Sue" and "Runnin Wild") so that you can hear how they vary in their interpretation. Oh, and the Art Pepper solos are really good, too. </span></p>\n<p>Here''s Barney with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaJPlHQwkgk" target="_blank">Some Like It Hot</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaJPlHQwkgk" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/Barney-Kessel.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Some Like It Hot 4:15</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">I Wanna Be Loved by You 3:37</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Stairway to the Stars 3:16</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Sweet Sue 4:42</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Sweet Sue 4:48</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Runnin'' Wild 3:19</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Runnin'' Wild 6:31</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Sweet Georgia Brown 3:39</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Down Among the Sheltering Palms 4:01</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Sugar Blues 3:24</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">I''m Thru with Love 3:14</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">By the Beautiful Sea 3:10</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 61, '2015-03-20 13:41:09', 62, '', '2016-08-17 17:58:19', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-03-31 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 2, 0, 1, 'on this day in jazz, Barney Kessel', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 1583, '');

His improvisations (mostly on tenor) push the boundaries of this already adventurous music and his sound (which occasionally hints a little at Clifford Jordan) is quite original; on the basis of this date alone, Lovano must rank as one of the top tenors of the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Here''s Joe with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz2X_mhn5i4" target="_blank">Prelude to a Kiss</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz2X_mhn5i4" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/Joe-Lovano-image-by-Jimmy-Katz.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Track listing:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Prelude to a Kiss" (Duke Ellington, Irving Gordon, Irving Mills) - 3:58</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Peggy''s Blue Skylight" (Charles Mingus) - 3:33</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Wildcat" - 2:57</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Angel Eyes" (Earl Brent, Matt Dennis) - 5:09</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Rush Hour On 23rd Street" (Gunther Schuller) - 8:53</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Crespuscle With Nellie" (Thelonious Monk) - 5:43</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Lament For M" (Schuller) - 5:41</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Topsy Turvy" - 4:27</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The Love I Long For" (Howard Dietz, Vernon Duke) - 3:11</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Juniper''s Garden" - 2:40</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Kathline Gray" (Ornette Coleman) - 3:26</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Headin'' Out Movin'' In" (Schuller) - 11:13</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Chelsea Bridge" (Billy Strayhorn) - 3:41</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 62, '2015-03-20 16:19:26', 62, '', '2016-08-17 21:21:23', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-04-06 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 3, 0, 25, 'on this day in jazz, Joe Lavano', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 2148, '');

Jazz reviewer Scott Yanow said "this live set gives one a rare opportunity to hear his quintet stretching out on songs that were more familiar to them."

Joining Johnny were an all star rhythm section of <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wynton-kelly-mn0000684253/biography" target="_blank">Wynton Kelly</a> at the piano, Curly Russell on bass and <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/max-roach-mn0000396372/biography" target="_blank">Max Roach</a> on drums--wow. By the way, it''s documented that Johnny and Rudy did not get along--the only time I''ve ever heard that Rudy didn''t have a good relationship with the artist.</p>\n<p>I know that Johnny isn''t a household name these days, but during the 1940s and 1950s he was in high demand--he just didn''t record that often as a leader. While he was in high school (DuSable High School in Chicago), Johnny played clarinet, oboe and alto saxophone. At the ripe old age of 15, he was a member of T-Bone Walker''s brother''s band (at this point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Bone_Walker" target="_blank">T-Bone</a> wasn''t a leader). Then, three days after graduating high school he was ''enlisted'' to play with <a href="http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/hampton/bio.html" target="_blank">Lionel Hampton</a>''s big band. It was Lionel that convinced Johnny to take up the tenor saxophone--and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>I really wish that history had been a little kinder to Johnny (with respect to the credit that his name garners), but I think Johnny was pretty happy about how he lived his life--i.e., quite content to be one of the best saxophonists in the world, but not wanting to have the spotlight always shining on him. <span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Johnny moved to Europe in the 1963 and from that point onwards he was essentially the tenor sax in residence that all touring US leaders would pick up to play with them.

This was Herbie''s final album for Blue Note Records--and,   oh!, what a run it was. If you''ve never treated yourself to some of the greatest modern piano jazz ever written, skip back fifty years and listen to Herbie Hancock''s mid 1960s'' works. They sound as fresh today as they must have sounded back then--and that is why they stand the test of time.</p>\n<p>On the album, Herbie plays both standard and electric pianos, and just a short list of people who assisted on the recording were: Johnny Coles on flugelhorn, Garnett Brown on trombone, <a href="http://www.joehendersonsax.com/" target="_blank">Joe Henderson</a> on tenor saxophone and alto flute, Buster Williams on the bass, and Tootie Heath on the drums.</p>\n<p>If you are familiar with pop culture, you might think that the title is in some way related to the British cult classic TV show of the same name. It''s not. It was a social statement regarding "how black people have been imprisoned for a long time." (Herbie Hancock). For the song "Firewater", he said that it represents the social duality of the oppressor and the oppressed: the fire symbolizes the heat in violence and (abuse of) power, whilst the feeling of water recalls Martin Luther King. The song "He Who Lives in Fear" is also linked to King (due to the atmosphere of intimidation he worked in). You wouldn''t think that such a song would end up as a jingle--but it did for Silva Thins Cigarettes'' TV commercial. The song "Promise of the Sun" symbolizes "how the sun promises life and freedom to all living things, and yet blacks are not yet free."</p>\n<p>At the time of this writing (2015), Herbie is on tour with <a href="http://chickcorea.com/" target="_blank">Chick Corea</a>--go see them!

In fact, it''s probably the reason I eventually was moved to create this blog. You can find the album in mono, stereo, SACD format, and DVD audio. On some of the legacy editions they''ve even included the banter between Miles and the engineers and musicians--which is quite interesting to hear. On December 16, 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution which honored the albums 50th anniversary, "reaffirming jazz as a national treasure".

First,   get the tool ffmpeg. Here''s a link to another tutorial on how to compile it on linux (they have tutorials for other OSs,   too):  <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu" target="_blank">https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu</a></p>\n<p>Once you have ffmpeg installed,   what you need to do to switch an audio channel from right to left and left to right is the following statement:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af "pan=stereo|c0</span></p>\n<p>I did the above to switch audio channels for one of my Coltrane albums because I was camped out on my deck beside one speaker and was only really hearing the rhythm section. Switching the channels allowed me to hear John first with the rhythm section in the background.</p>\n<p>Another thing you might want to do is to mix both channels into both channels. That way you can sit by one speaker and hear both John and the rhythm section all together. It is pretty simple to accomplish--just do this:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af "pan=stereo|c0</span></p>\n<p>Now that you have the hang of it, just put it in a loop to get all the songs in a directory:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">for i in *.mp3; do ffmpeg -i $i -af "pan=stereo|c0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">After running the command above, you''ll have another set of recordings prefixed with the letter "o" then with the same name as the originals. You could just create a new directory and redirect the output there with the original file names.</span></p>\n<p>More examples are <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioChannelManipulation" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>', '', 0, 7, 0, 51, '2015-04-27 15:23:40', 62, '', '2015-04-27 15:33:01', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-04-27 15:12:35', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 6, 0, 1, '', '', 0, 0, '');

Billboard said that it contained "mighty good jazz", while allmusic gives it four out of five stars, saying that Art and Thelonious "are at the peak of their respective prowess with insightful interpretations of nearly half a dozen inspired performances". Additionally, the <em>Penguin Guide to Jazz</em> gave it a "Crown". On item of trivia: during the time of this recording Thelonious had lost his cabaret card and was banned from playing in New York City clubs. He would regain it a month later and take up a residency at the famed Five Spot with his quartet--a quartet that would feature <a href="http://www.johncoltrane.com/" target="_blank">John Coltrane</a> coming into his own. It was those sessions that really made Monk marketable and led to the studios releasing this record about a year after it was actually recorded.</p>\n<p>Note that on February 16, 1999, Rhino Records reissued the album remastered for compact disc.

The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave it four and a half stars, saying that the album was as "mathematically complex as its title suggests and as rich in colour and sound as the ensemble proposes". Scott Yanow of allmusic.com said this of the album:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After several years off records, pianist Cecil Taylor finally had an opportunity to document his music of the mid-''60s on two Blue Note albums (the other one was <em>Conquistador</em>). Taylor''s high-energy atonalism fit in well with the free jazz of the period but he was actually leading the way rather than being part of a movement. In fact, this septet outing with trumpeter Eddie Gale, altoist Jimmy Lyons, Ken McIntyre (alternating between alto, oboe and bass clarinet), both Henry Grimes and Alan Silva on basses, and drummer Andrew Cyrille is quite stunning and very intense. In fact, it could be safely argued that no jazz music of the era approached the ferocity and intensity of Cecil Taylor''s.</p>\n<p>If this album is a little "too much" for you, I suggest checking out <em>Jazz Advance</em> or <em>Looking Ahead!</em> before trying to tackle this one....and if those are too much, start with <em>Love for Sale</em>.</p>\n<p>Here''s Cecil with "Steps":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_woT6Mgp64c" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/unitstructuresfront.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="250" /><img src="images/tdij/unitstructures-back.jpg" border="0" width="228" height="228" /></a></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Track listing:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Steps" – 10:20</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Enter, Evening" – 11:06</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Enter, Evening [alternate take]" – 10:11 Bonus track on CD release</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Unit Structure/As of a Now/Section" – 17:47</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Tales (8 Whisps)" – 7:14</span><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em; white-space: pre;"> </span></li>\n</ol>', '', 1, 8, 0, 63, '2015-05-12 17:40:53', 62, '', '2016-08-17 21:48:51', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-05-19 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 2, 0, 14, 'on this day in jazz, Cecil Taylor', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 4105, '');

Due to this decision, the entire concept of the album changed. The initial plan for the album was that it would consist of all originals written by Dexter. Well, let''s just say that Bud didn''t want to play any of the new songs, so the compromise that was made was for the album to consist entirely of jazz standards. That''s too bad, but the album still became one of Dexter''s most beloved works and won several accolades including being selected as part of the <em>Penguin Guide to Jazz</em>''s core collection (along with a perfect four-star rating). allmusic.com gave it a high rating (four and a half out of five stars), also.</div>\n<div>Here''s Dexter with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjJFft1QQeU" target="_blank">A Night in Tunisia</a>":</div>\n<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjJFft1QQeU" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/omip.jpg" border="0" height="250" /><img src="images/tdij/omipb.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;"> </span></div>\n<div>Track listing:</div>\n<div><ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Scrapple from the Apple" (Parker) – 7:22</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Willow Weep for Me" (Ronell) – 8:47</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Broadway" (Billy Byrd, McRae, Henri Woode) – 6:44</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Stairway to the Stars" (Malneck, Parish, Signorelli) – 6:57</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"A Night in Tunisia" (Gillespie, Frank Paparelli) – 8:15 </span></li>\n</ol></div>', '', 1, 8, 0, 63, '2015-05-16 17:19:23', 62, '', '2016-08-17 21:50:42', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-05-23 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 4, 0, 10, 'on this day in jazz, Dexter Gordon', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 5184, '');

The album consists of duets with violinist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bang" target="_blank">Billy Bang</a>. The album is regarded as avant-garde-world-fusion and presents some rather unusual instruments such as the Berimbau and Kalimba played by Kahil. Derek Taylor writing for allaboutjazz.com said that "Bang is one of the few improvisors around that can completely complement and match El''Zabar''s measure of spiritual fire and passionate emotionalism in his instrument." That is,   they played well together. If you are looking for something a little off the beaten path, this album should meet that need. If you like this album, you''ll also like the live album they recorded together in 2005, <em>Live at the River East Art Center</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, a little about Kahil. He was born in Chicago in 1953 and attended the Chicagoland college, Lake Forest College. Into the early 1970s, he joined the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and would later go on to become the chairman of that group. Throughout his career he has recorded mainly with two groups that he formed: Ritual Trio and Ethnic Heritage Ensemble; however, he has also collaborated with many of jazz''s royalty such as <a href="http://www.dizzygillespie.com/" target="_blank">Dizzy Gillespie</a> and <a href="http://www.cannonball-adderley.com/" target="_blank">Cannonball Adderley</a> as well as other well-known musicians such as Nina Simone, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder.

And. if you get a chance, go see him on tour.</p>\n<p>But back, to this album...Steve Huey, writing for allmusic.com said this of the work: "So even if, in retrospect, Takin'' Off is among Hancock''s most conventional albums, it shows a young stylist already strikingly mature for his age, and one who can interpret established forms with spirit and imagination....All in all, Takin'' Off is an exceptional first effort, laying the groundwork for Hancock to begin pushing the boundaries of hard bop on his next several records."

This particular trio may lack some of the sheer combustive force of the better-known lineup, but it is, if possible, even more sensitive, melancholic, and nostalgic than the previous band.... Jazz is rarely as sensitive or as melodic as this. Another classic from Bill Evans and company.</p>\n<p>The album is comprised of 8 songs, 7 of which are covers, and most of them standards.

Some said that he collapsed in this hotel room; however, others state that he collapsed on stage and the attending physicians believed the collapse was related to substance abuse (as was common to jazz musicians of that time) and was left in a hospital bed for the drugs to run their course which caused his death.</p>\n<p>Here''s Eric with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO_xsFSftDA" target="_blank">Epistrophy</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO_xsFSftDA" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/last-date-front.jpg" border="0" height="250" /> <span style="white-space: pre;"><img src="images/tdij/last-date-back.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></span></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Epistrophy" (Monk)– 11:15</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"South Street Exit" – 7:10</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The madrig speaks, the panther walks" – 4:50</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Hypochristmutreefuzz" (Mengelberg)– 5:25</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"You don''t know what love is" (Raye/De Paul)– 11:20</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Miss Ann" — 5:25</span></li>\n</ol>', '', 1, 8, 0, 64, '2015-05-26 18:36:20', 62, '', '2016-08-18 19:27:15', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-06-02 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 5, 0, 29, 'On this day in jazz, Eric Dolphy', 'On this day in jazz', 0, 4378, '');

In fact the impact that he made on Dizzy alone should cause him to be regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the swing era. He started playing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artie_Shaw" target="_blank">Artie Shaw</a>''s band in 1944 and was the only non-Caucasian member of that band. As you can imagine, he faced a lot of racism when playing in predominantly white venues and while touring with the band. Artie once said this about Roy''s time with the band: "Droves of people would ask him for his autograph at the end of the night, but later, on the bus, he wouldn''t be able to get off and buy a hamburger with the guys in the band." Another time, while playing in Gene Krupa''s big band, Gene ended up in jail and was heavily fined for starting a fistfight with a restaurant manager who refused to let Eldridge eat with the rest of the band.</p>\n<p>Roy continued to play throughout his life until he suffered a heart attack in 1980 (at age 69).

In an interview with <em>The New York Times</em> in 1991, Cecil said this about his influences and himself in general:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Literature, theater, it''s all important....You want to create the utmost that is possible, to continue the ideas of certain people who have enriched your life. The Nicholas Brothers or Bojangles, you see them and you start to dance. The love of and respect for the creative impulse everywhere is what I''m after. I''m of American, Indian, African and English heritage, and I follow all those paths. Someone once asked me if I was gay. I said, ''Do you think a three-letter word defines the complexity of my humanity?'' I avoid the trap of easy definition.</p>\n<p>Here''s Cecil from 1956 with "<a href="http://iisaphd.subsonic.org/share/rClYu" target="_blank">Bemsha Swing</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="http://iisaphd.subsonic.org/share/rClYu" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/cecil-taylor-4.jpg" border="0" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Track listing:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"J." - 2:52</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Pethro Visiting the Abyss" - 7:08</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Saita" - 3:00</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"For Steve McCall" (Gergg Bendian) 1:00</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"In Florescence" - 3:02</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Ell Moving Track" - 5:15</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Sirenes 1/3" - 0:48</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Anast in Crisis Mouthful of Fresh Cut Flowers" (William Parker) - 3:37</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Charles And Thee" - 8:00</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Entity" (Bendian) - 2:32</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Leaf Taken Horn" - 4:53</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Chal Chuiatlichue Goddess of Green Flowing Waters" - 11:29</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Morning Of Departure" - 3:13</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Feng Shui" (Taylor, Bendian, Parker) - 4:35</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 64, '2015-06-03 00:05:32', 62, '', '2016-08-18 19:29:23', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-06-08 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 2, 0, 23, 'On this day in jazz, Cecil Taylor', 'On this day in jazz', 0, 4805, '');

In his review, Richard S. Ginell said this of the album:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...this stunningly seductive record, possibly Jobim''s best. Jobim contributes his sparely rhythmic acoustic guitar, simple melodic piano style, a guest turn at the harpsichord, and even a vocal on "Lamento," while Claus Ogerman lends a romantically brooding hand with the charts.

But though he was a modernist, Ammons maintained that breathy, old-school romantic approach to the tenor. Boss Tenor, a quintet session from 1960, is one of Ammons'' very best albums."</p>\n<p>A little bit about Gene: he was born in Chicago and gained recognition while still in high school (1943). In 1944, he joined Billy Eckstine''s band. It was Billy who gave him the nickname, Jug, which was based on the size of his head. While in this band he was able to play alongside such jazz greats as Charlie Parker and Dexter Gordon. He was very prolific in the 1950s, but in 1958 he was convicted of narcotics possession and served time from 1958 to 1960. Unfortunately, he didn''t learn his lesson and ended up serving a second sentence from 1962 to 1969. However, when he was released from Joliet, he was signed the largest contract the Prestige label had ever given and recorded for them until he did from cancer in 1974. Although he only spent five years on the label, he produced 18 albums in that time.

By varying the styles and instrumentation (for example "Bread and Wine" does not have piano or bass), Lovano has created a set with a great deal of variety and some surprising moments. The two tenors (who have distinctive sounds) work together fine and some chances are taken. This matchup works well.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">I agree, it is a really good album.

In his review, William Ruhlmann notes that the two had played together over the past 40 years and had very good chemistry; however, he would also add:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">they sound comfortable with each other, but also, given their long association and the mostly familiar material, they don''t seem to have been greatly challenged. They sound most comfortable with the Monk tunes and take some chances with the Ellington, but on Lacy''s tunes they sometimes stretch out pointlessly.</p>\n<p>Despite the harsh criticism in that sentence, he gives the album four out of five stars--so it''s definitely worth a listen.</p>\n<p>Here''s Steve and Roswell with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfpHUbLsv6Y" target="_blank">Monk''s Dream</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfpHUbLsv6Y" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/sl-md-f.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="250" /><img src="images/tdij/sl-md-b.jpg" border="0" width="275" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Monk''s Dream" (Monk) - 7:35</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The Bath" - 11:43</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The Rent" - 10:45</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Pannonica" (Monk) - 9:26</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"A Bright Pearl" - 5:55</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Traces" (text by Ry?kan) - 8:03</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Koko" (Ellington) - 5:21</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Grey Blue" - 10:08</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The Door" - 7:05</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 64, '2015-06-16 22:11:34', 62, '', '2016-08-18 19:34:39', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-06-21 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 2, 0, 10, 'on this day in jazz, Steve Lacy, Roswell Rudd', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 4406, '');

Oh, by the way, they ALL played percussion also.</p>\n<p>If you are not familiar with The Art Ensemble of Chicago, here is a little bit about them. They were an avant-garde jazz ensemble that formed from out of Chicago''s AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians) in the late 1960s from members of the Roscoe Mitchell Sextet which had formed in 1966. The Sextet included saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell, trumpeter Lester Bowie and bassist Malachi Favors Maghostut, who (over the next year) became the Roscoe Mitchell Art Ensemble. It was in 1967 they were joined by fellow AACM members Joseph Jarman and Phillip Wilson and began to record as the Chicago Art Ensemble. The group continued to record through 2006 when their last album Non-Cognitive Aspects of the City was recorded for Pi Recordings. They are well known for integrating the musical styles across jazz''s entire history into their recordings and also for each of them being multi-instrumentalists. They were never afraid to pull in any kind of instrument that could produce the sound that they needed and have used bicycle horns, bells, birthday party noisemakers, wind chimes, and even "found objects"--in fact, for their European tour to support this album they had over 500 instruments at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Here''s the Art Ensemble of Chicago with "A Jackson In Your House":</p>\n<p><a href="http://iisaphd.subsonic.org/share/tljDq" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/aec-aj-f.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="250" /><img src="images/tdij/aec-aj-b.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Track listing:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"A Jackson In Your House" – 5:40</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Get In Line" – 5:45</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"The Waltz" – 1:15</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Ericka" (Jarman) – 3:33</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Song For Charles" – 17:30</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 64, '2015-06-20 18:26:19', 62, '', '2016-08-18 19:35:13', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-06-23 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 3, 0, 8, 'on this day in jazz, Art Ensemble of Chicago', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 4491, '');

The album consists of just one song--however,   in order to release it--it had to be divided in half for the LP format. There were actually two takes of the song. The first take is referred to as Edition II and the second take as Edition I. As you may have guessed, Edition I was the one originally released on LP in 1966. John, however, preferred his first take (Edition II) and (maybe for the first time in history), they stopped printing the LP with the first Edition and moved to the second. If you have the record, you can look into the runout circle to see if you have the first or second edition. If it is the second, it will say EDITION II in the circle.

It''s also an album that some jazz fans would say is a go-to when they just want to unwind and hear something soothing.</p>\n<p>Here''s another reason Charles is considered one of the greatest composers in history: he wrote a 4000 bar piece called "Epitaph" (<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92884124" target="_blank">which can be found on the internet</a>). You might wonder how long does it take to play 4000 bars? Well, it takes over 2 hours to play! The reason he titled it "Epitaph" was because (due to its length) he felt no one would ever play or record it while he was alive. <span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller (who, sadly, passed away on June 21, 2015). This concert was produced by Mingus''s widow, Sue Graham Mingus, at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989--ten years after Mingus'' death. It was performed again at several concerts in 2007.

I agree. Thom Jurek provides an excellent review of the album at allmusic.com. Here are the salient parts of that review:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Given their respective careers up to this point, both men had nearly perfected the artistry of playing in this particular chamber jazz setting. That all said, it does not prepare the listener for the canny, intimate, yet absolutely electric interplay on offer here. From readings of standards such as "Bemsha Swing," "Body and Soul," and Skylark" through to Ornette Coleman''s "Turnaround" and excellent originals by both men -- including Haden''s bookends, the tenderly dissonant "First Song" and the knotty "In the Moment," and Hall''s sprightly melodic Latin waltz "Down from Antigua" and his fingerpopping "Big Man Blues" -- this music is an adventure top to bottom. It unfolds gradually and cannily over 76 minutes. Ethan Iverson''s liner essay is spirited, insightful, and illuminating to boot. This set is not only impossible to criticize, but adds an immeasurable depth to the catalogs of both artists.</p>\n<p>Here''s Charlie and Jim with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9lfJ98Hpck" target="_blank">Bemsha Swing</a>":</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9lfJ98Hpck" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/ch-jh.jpg" border="0" width="395" height="250" /></a></p>\n<p>Track listing:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Bemsha Swing (Thelonious Monk/Denzil Best)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">First Song (Charlie Haden)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Turnaround (Ornette Coleman)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Body & Soul (John Green/Edward Heyman/Robert Sour)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Down From Antigua (Jim Hall)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Skylark (Hoagy Carmichael/Johnny Mercer)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Big Blues (Hall)</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">In The Moment (Haden)</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>', '', 1, 8, 0, 53, '2015-06-28 13:21:46', 62, '', '2016-08-20 01:05:07', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-07-02 06:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', '', 4, 0, 7, 'on this day in jazz, Charlie Haden, Jim Hall', 'on this day in jazz', 0, 14485, '');

The performance can be found on the album <em>Dizzy Gillespie at Newport</em>. Dizzy led a large band in this one (about 15 or so players) which included jazz greats such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Morgan" target="_blank">Lee Morgan</a>, <a href="http://www.bennygolson.com/" target="_blank">Benny Golson</a>, and <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wynton-kelly-mn0000684253/biography" target="_blank">Wynton Kelly</a>. Scott Yanow reviewed the album for allmusic.com saying:</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This CD features Dizzy Gillespie''s second great big band at the peak of its powers. On the rapid "Dizzy''s Blues" and a truly blazing "Cool Breeze," the orchestra really roars; the latter performance features extraordinary solos...This brilliant CD captures one of the high points of Dizzy Gillespie''s remarkable career and is highly recommended.</p>\r\n<p>The album features the song "Manteca" which is considered to be foundational to Afro-Cuban jazz. It was written by Dizzy, Chano Pozo and Gil Fuller in 1947. Gary Giddens of the Village Voice calls it "one of the most important records ever made in the United States". The song was the first tune based on the clave rhythmic pattern to become a jazz standard. If you listen closely, you can hear the band chant, "I''ll never go back to Georgia", during the song. This chant was in reference to racial prejudice that the band had experienced there in 1945.</p>\r\n<p>Here''s Dizzy with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy6tJFzZnts" target="_blank">Manteca</a>":</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy6tJFzZnts" target="_blank"><img src="images/tdij/dg-an-f.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="250" /></a></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Track listing:</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"Dizzy''s Blues" (Ahmad Kharab Salim) – 11:51</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">"School Days" (Will D.

INSERT INTO `jos_content` VALUES(472, 'Gatley', 'gatley', '', '<h1 class="block_8">(p924-p933)Gately, for several months before he did his State assault-bit,</h1>\r\n<p>was disastrously involved with one Pamela Hoffman-Jeep, his first girl ever with a hyphen, a sort of upscale but directionless and not very healthy and pale and incredibly passive Danvers girl that worked in Purchasing for a hospital-supply co. in Swampscott and was pretty definitely an alcoholic and drank bright drinks with umbrellas in Rte. 1 clubs in the late P.M. until she swooned and passed out with a loud clunk. That’s what she called it—‘swooned.’ The swooning and passing out with a loud clunk as her head hit the table was more or less a nightly thing, and Pamela Hoffman-Jeep fell automatically in love with any man she termed ‘chivalrous’ <span id="f374"> </span><span class="calibre4"><sup>374</sup></span> enough to carry her out to the parking lot and drive her home without raping her, which rape of an unconscious head-lolling girl she termed ‘Taking Advantage.’ Gately got introduced to her by Fackelmann, who one time as he came up through a sports bar called the Pourhouse’s parking lot to dialogue with a Sorkin-debtor Gately saw Fackelmann staggering along carrying this unconscious girl to his ride, one big hand quite a bit farther up her prom-looking taffeta gown than it really needed to be to carry her, and Fackelmann told Gately if Don’d give this gash a ride home he’d stay and do the collection, which Gately’s heart wasn’t in collections anymore and he jumped at the trade, as long as Fackelmann could promise him she could hold her various fluids in the 4×4 he was driving. So it was Fackelmann who told him, as he put the tiny and limp but still continent body in his arms in the parking lot of the Pourhouse, to watch his personal six, Gately, and be sure and violate her a little, because this gash here was like one of those South Sea–culture gashes in that if Gately took her home and she woke up nonviolated she’d be Gately’s for life. But Gately obviously had no intention of raping an unconscious person, much less even putting his hand up the gown of a girl that might lose her fluids any second, and this locked him into the involvement. Pamela Hoffman-Jeep called Gately her ‘Night-Errand’ and fell passively in love with his refusal to Take Advantage. Gene Fackelmann, she confided, was not the gentleman Gately was.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p class="block_9">What helped make the involvement disastrous was that Pamela Hoffman-Jeep was always either so leglessly drunk or so passively hungover all the time that any sort of sex any time at all with her would have classified as Taking Advantage.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">This girl was the single passivest person Gately ever met. He never once saw P.H.-J. actually get from one spot to another under her own power. She needed somebody chivalrous to pick her up and carry her and lay her back down 24/7/365, it seemed like. She was a sort of sexual papoose. She spent most of her life passed out and sleeping. She was a beautiful sleeper, kittenish and serene, never drooling. She made passivity and unconsciousness look kind of beautiful. Fackelmann called her Death’s Poster-Child. Even at work, at the hospital supply co., Gately imagined her horizontal, curled fetal on something soft, with all the hot slack facial intensity of a sleeping baby. He imagined her bosses and coworkers all tiptoeing around Purchasing whispering to each other to not wake her up. She never once rode in the actual front seat of any vehicle he drove her home in. But she also never threw up or pissed herself or even complained, just smiled and yawned an infant’s little milky yawn and snuggled deeper into whatever Gately had swaddled her in. Gately started doing that thing about yelling they’d been robbed when he carried her into whatever stripped luxury apt. they were crewing in. P.H.-J. wasn’t what you’d call great-looking, but she was incredibly sexy, Gately felt, because she always managed to look like you’d just X’d her into a state of total unmuscled swoon, lying there unconscious. Trent Kite told Fackelmann he thought Gately was out of his fucking mind. Fax observed that Kite himself was not exactly a W. T. Sherman with the ladies, even with coke-whores and strung-out nursing students and dipsoid lounge-hags whose painted faces swung loose from their heads. Fackelmann claimed to have started a Log just to keep track of Kite’s attempted pickup lines—surefire lines like e.g. ‘You’re the second most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, the first most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen being former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,’ and ‘If you came home with me I’m unusually confident that I could achieve an erection,’ and said that if Kite wasn’t still cherry at twenty-three and a half it was proof of some kind of divine-type grace.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">Sometimes Gately would come out of a Demerol-nod and look at pale passive Pamela lying there sleeping beautifully and undergo a time-lapse clairvoyant thing where he could almost visibly watch her losing her looks through her twenties and her face starting to slide over off her skull onto the pillow she held like a stuffed toy, becoming a lounge-hag right before his eyes. The vision aroused more compassion than horror, which Gately never even considered might qualify him as a decent person.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">Gately’s two favorite things about Pamela Hoffman-Jeep were: the way she would come out of her stupor and hold her cheek and laugh hysterically each time Gately carried her across the threshold of some stripped apartment and bellow that they’d been ripped off; and the way she always wore the long white linen gloves and bare-shoulder taffeta that made her seem like some upscale North Shore debutante who’s had like one too many dippers of country-club punch and is just begging to be Taken Advantage of by some low-rent guy with a tattoo—she’d make a sort of languid very-slow-motion bullwhip-gesture with her hand in the long white glove as she lay wherever Gately had deposited her and simper out with an upscale inflection ‘Don Honey, bring Mommy a highball’ (she called a drink a highball), which it turned out was a deadly impression of her own Mom, who it turned out this lady made Gately’s own Mom look like Carry Nation by comparison, lush-wise: the only four times Gately ever met Mrs. H.-J. were all at E.R.s and sanitaria.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">Gately lies there pop-eyed with guilt and anxiety in the hiss and click of resumed sleet, in the twilit St. E.’s room, next to the glittering back-brace-and-skull-halo thing clamped exoskeletally to the empty next bed and gleaming dully at selected welds, Gately trying to Abide, remembering. It had been Pamela Hoffman-Jeep that finally clued Gately in on the little ways Gene Fackelmann had been historically getting over on Whitey Sorkin, and alerted him to the suicidal creek Fackelmann had got himself into with a certain mistaken-bet scam that had blown up right in his map. Even Gately had been able to tell something was the matter: for the last two weeks Fackelmann had been squatting sweatily in a corner of the stripped living room, right outside the little luxury bedroom Gately and Pamela were lying in, out there squatting over his Sterno cooker and incredible twin hills of sky-blue Dilaudid and many-hued M&M’s, not much speaking or responding or moving or even seeming to cop a nod, just sitting there hunched and plump and glistening like some sort of cornered toad, his mustache flailing around on his lip. Things would have had to be bad indeed for Gately ever to try to get coherent data out of P.H.-J. Apparently the deal was that one of the bettors that bet with Sorkin through Fackelmann was a guy Gately and Fackelmann know only as Eighties Bill, an impeccably groomed guy that wore red suspenders under snazzy Zegna-brand menswear and tortoiseshell specs and Docksiders, an old-fashioned corporate take-overer and asset-plunderer, maybe fifty, with an Exchange Place office and a souvenir FREE MILKEN bumper sticker on his Beamer—it was a night of many highballs and much papoosing, and Gately had to keep flicking the top of P.H.-J.’s skull to keep her conscious long enough to free-associate her way through the details—who was on his fourth marriage to his third aerobics instructor, and who liked to bet only on Ivy League college hoops, but who when he did so—bet—bet amounts so huge that Fackelmann always had to get Sorkin’s pre-approval on the bet and then call Eighties Bill back, and so on.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">But so—according to Pamela Hoffman-Jeep—this Eighties Bill, who’s a Yale alum and usually unabashedly sentimental about what Pamela H.-J. laughingly says Fackelmann called his ‘almometer’—well, on this particular time it seems like a little impeccably groomed birdie has whispered in Eighties Bill’s hairy ear, because this one time Eighties Bill wants to put $125K down on Brown U. against Yale U., i.e. betting against his almometer, only he wants (–2) points instead of the even spread Sorkin and the rest of the Boston books are taking off the Atlantic City line for a spread. And Fackelmann has to cell-phone down to Saugus to bounce this off Sorkin, except Sorkin’s down in the city in Enfield at the National Cranio-Facial Pain Foundation office getting his weekly UV-bombardment and Cafergot refill from Dr. Robert (‘Sixties Bob’) Monroe—the septuagenarian pink-sunglasses-and-Nehru-jacket-wearing N.C.-F.P.F. ergotic-vascular-headache-treatment specialized, a guy who in yore-days interned at Sandoz and was one of T. Leary’s original circle of mayonnaise-jar acid-droppers at T. Leary’s now-legendary house in West Newton MA, and is now (60s B.) an intimate acquaintance of Kite, because Sixties Bob is an even bigger Grateful Dead fanatic maybe even than Kite, and sometimes got together with Kite and several other Dead devotees (most of who now had canes and O2 tanks) and traded historical-souvenir-type tiger’s eyes and paisley doublets and tie-dyes and lava lamps and bandannas and plasma spheres and variegated black-light posters of involuted geometric designs, and argued about which Dead shows and bootlegs of Dead shows were the greatest of all time in different regards, and just basically had a hell of a time. 60s B., an inveterate collector and haggling trader of shit, sometimes took Kite along on little expeditions of eclectic and seedy shops for Dead-related paraphernalia, sometimes even informally fencing stuff for Kite (and so indirectly Gately), covering Kite with $ when Kite’s rigid need-schedule didn’t permit a more formal and time-consuming fence, Sixties Bob then trading the merchandise around various seedy locales for 60s-related shit nobody else’d even usually want. A couple times Gately had to actually finger an ice cube out of a highball and slip it under the shoulderless neckline of P.H.-J.’s prom gown to try and keep her on some kind of track. Like most incredibly passive people, the girl had a terrible time ever separating details from what was really important to a story, is why she rarely ever got asked anything. But so the point is that the person that took Fackelmann’s call about Eighties Bill’s mammoth Yale-Brown bet wasn’t in fact Sorkin but rather Sorkin’s secretary, one Gwendine O’Shay, the howitzer-breasted old Green-Cardless former I.R.A.-moll who’d gotten hit on the head with a truncheon by a godless Belfast Bobbie once too often back on the Old Sod, and whose skull now was (in Fackelmann’s own terminology) soft as puppy-shit in the rain, but who had just the seedy sort of distracted-grandmotherly air that makes her perfect for clapping her red-knuckled old hands to her cheeks and squealing as she claimed Mass Lottery lottery winnings whenever Whitey Sorkin and his MA-Statehouse bagmen-cronies arrange to have a Sorkinite buy a mysteriously winning Mass Lottery ticket from one of the countless convenience stores Sorkin & cronies own through dummy corporations all up and down the North Shore, and who, because she could not only give what Sorkin claimed was the only adequate cervical massage west of the Berne Hot Alp Springs Center but also could both word-process a shocking 110 wpm and wield a shillelagh like nobody’s business—plus had been W. Sorkin’s dear late I.R.A.-moll Mum’s Scrabble-pal back in Belfast, on the Old Sod—served as Whitey’s chief administrative aide, manning the cellular phones when Sorkin was out or indisposed.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">And so but P.H.-J.’s point, which Gately has to just about crack her scalp open flicking out of her: Gwendine O’Shay, familiar with Eighties Bill and his Y.U. Bulldog sentimentality, plus cranially soft as a fucking grape, O’Shay took Fackelmann’s call wrong, thought Fackelmann said Eighties Bill wanted 125K with (–2) points on Yale instead of (–2) on Brown, put Fackelmann on Hold and made him listen to Irish Muzak while she put in a call to a Yale Athletic Dept. mole out of Sorkin’s Read-Protected database’s MOLE file and learned that the Yale U. Bulldogs’ star power forward had been diagnosed with an extremely rare neurologic disorder called Post-Coital Vestibulitis <span id="f375"> </span><span class="calibre4"><sup>375</sup></span> in which for several hours after intercourse the power forward tended to suffer such a terrible vertiginous loss of proprioception that he literally couldn’t tell his ass from his elbow, much less make an authoritative move to the bucket. Plus then O’Shay’s second call, to Sorkin’s Brown U. athletic mole (a locker-room attendant everybody thinks is deaf), reveals that several of Brown U.’s most sirenish and school-spirited hetero coeds had been recruited, auditioned, briefed, rehearsed (i.e. ‘debriefed,’ giggles Pamela Hoffman-Jeep, whose giggles involve the sort of ticklish shoulder-writhing undulations of a much younger girl getting tickled by an authority figure and pretending not to like it), and stationed at strategic points—I–95 rest-stops, in the spare-tire compartment at the rear of the Bulldogs’ chartered bus, in the evergreen shrubbery outside the teams’ special entrance to the Pizzitola Athl. Center in Providence, in concave recesses along the Pizzitola tunnels between special entrance and Visitors’ locker room, even in a specially enlarged and sensually-appointed locker next to the power forward’s locker in the VLR, all prepared—like the Brown cheerleaders and Pep Squad, who’ve been induced to do the game pantyless, electrolysized and splits-prone to help lend a pyrotechnic glandular atmosphere to the power forward’s whole playing-environment—prepared to make the penultimate sacrifice for squad, school, and influential members of the Brown Alumni Bruins Boosters Assoc. So that Gwendine O’Shay then switches back to Fackelmann and OKs the mammoth bet and point-spread, as like who wouldn’t, with that kind of mole-reported fix in the works. Except of course she’s taken the wager backwards, i.e. O’Shay thinks Eighties Bill’s now got 125K on Yale coming within two points, while Eighties Bill—who it turns out’s cast himself as White Knight in bidding for majority control of Providence’s Federated Funnel and Cone Corp., O.N.A.N.’s leading manufacturer of conoid receptacles, with F.F.&C. CEO’d by a prominent Brown alumnus so rabid a Bruins-booster he actually wears a snarling hollow bear-head to conference games, whose ass Eighties Bill is going about kissing like nobody’s beeswax, P.H.-J. inserts, hinting it was Eighties Bill who’d tipped the Bruins staff off about the power forward’s Achilles’ vas deferens—E.B. quite reasonably believes he’s now got Brown within a deuce for 125 el grande’s.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The wrench in the ointment that nobody in Providence has counted on is the picket-and-knuckleduster-wielding appearance of Brown University’s entire Dworkinite Female Objectification Prevention And Protest Phalanx outside the Pizzitola Athl. Center’s main gates right at game-time, two FOPPPs per motorcycle, who blow through the filigreed gates like they were so much wet Kleenex and storm the arena, plus a division of Brown’s pluckier undergraduate N.O.W.s who execute a pincer-movement down from the cheap seats up top during the first time-out, at the precise moment the Brown cheerleaders’ first pyramid-maneuver ends in a mid-air split that causes the Pizzitola’s scoreboard’s scorekeeper to reel backward against his controls and blow out both HOME’s and VISITORS’ zeroes, on the board, just as the FOPPPs’ unmuffled Hawgs come blatting malevolently down through the ground-level tunnels and out onto the playing floor; and in the ensuing melee not only are cheerleaders, Pep Squad, and comely Brown U. sirens all either laid out with picket-signs wielded like shillelaghs or thrown kicking and shrieking over the burly shoulders of militant FOPPPs and carried off on roaring Hawgs, leaving the Yale power forward’s delicate nervous system intact if overheated; but two Brown U. Bruin starters, a center and a shooting guard—both too wrung-out and dazed by a grueling week of comely-siren-auditioning and -rehearsing to have sense enough to run like hell once the melee spills out onto the Pizzitola hardwood—are felled, by a FOPPP knuckleduster and a disoriented referee with a martial-arts background, respectively; and so when the floor is finally cleared and stretchers borne off and the game resumes, Yale U. cleans Brown U.’s clock by upwards of 20.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">Then so Fackelmann calls up Eighties Bill and arranges to pick up the skeet, which is $137,500 with the vig, which E.B. gives him in large-denomination pre-O.N.A.N. scrip in a GO BROWN BRUINS gym-bag he’d brought to the game to sit next to the ursine-headed CEO with and now has less than no use for, but so Fackelmann receives the skeet downtown and blasts up cheesy Route 1 to Saugus to deliver the skeet and pick up his vig on the vig ($625 U.S.) right away, needing to cop Blues in what’s starting to be the worst way, etc. Plus Fackelmann’s figuring on maybe a small bonus or at least some emotional validation from Sorkin for bringing in such a mammoth and promptly-remitted wager. But, when he gets to the Rte. 1 titty bar at the rear of which Sorkin has his administrative offices behind an unmarked fire door and all wallpapered in stuff that looks like ersatz wood panelling, Gwendine O’Shay wordlessly points behind her station at Sorkin’s personal office door with a terse gesture Fackelmann doesn’t think fits with the up-beatness of the occasion at all. The door’s got a big poster of R. Limbaugh on it, from before the assassination. Sorkin’s in there working spreadsheets with his special monitor-screen-light-filtering goggles on. The goggles’ lenses on their long protruding barrels look like lobsters’ eyes on stalks. Gately and Fackelmann and Bobby C never spoke to Sorkin until spoken to, not out of henchmanish obsequity but because they could never tell what Sorkin’s cranio-facial vascular condition was or if he could tolerate sound until they verifiably heard him tolerating his own. (Sound.)</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">So G. Fackelmann waits wordlessly to hand over Eighties Bill’s skeet, standing there tall and soft and palely sweating, the overall shape and color of a peeled boiled egg. When Sorkin hikes an eyebrow at the GO BRUINS bag and says the knee-slapping hilarity of the joke escapes him, Fackelmann’s mustache positively takes off all over his upper lip, and he prepares to say what he always says when he’s flummoxed, that whatever’s being said is with all due respect a goddamn lie. Sorkin saves his data and pushes his desk chair back so he can reach all the way down to the fireproof drawer. The goggles are often used in data-processing sweatshops and list for a deuce. Sorkin grunts as he hauls out a huge old Mass Lottery box for Quik-Pick cards and heaves it onto the desk, where it bulges obscenely, filled with 112.5K U.S.—there’s 112.5 fucking K in there, all in ones, 125K minus vig, what Sorkin via O’Shay believes to be Eighties Bill’s winnings, all in small bills, because Sorkin’s pissed off and can’t resist making a little like gesture. Fackelmann doesn’t say anything. His mustache goes limp as his mental machinery starts revving. Sorkin, massaging his temples, staring up at Fackelmann with his goggles like a crab in a tank, says he supposes he can’t blame Fax or O’Shay, that he’d have OK’d the bet himself, what with the neurologic tip on the Yale forward they had. Who could have foreseen thuggish Feminazis screwing up the ointment. He utters a bit of Gaelic that Fackelmann doesn’t know but assumes to be fatalistical. He peels six C-notes and an O.N.A.N.ite 25-spot off a wad the size of an artillery shell and pushes them across the metal desk at Fackelmann, his vig on the vig. He says What the fuck (Sorkin does), this Eighties Bill kid’s irrational sentimentalism for Yale will sooner or later catch up with him. Veteran books tend to be statistically philosophical and patient. Fackelmann doesn’t even bother to wonder why Sorkin refers to Eighties Bill as ‘kid’ when they’re both about the same age. But a high-watt bulb is slowly beginning to incandesce over Fackelmann’s moist head. As in the Faxter starts to conceptualize the overall concept of what must of happened. He still hasn’t said anything, Pamela Hoffman-Jeep emphasizes. Sorkin looks Fackelmann over and asks if he’s gained some asymmetrical-type weight, there. Fackelmann’s left tit does look noticeably bigger than his right, under his sport-coat, because of the legal envelope with 137 1000s and one 500 in it, the skeet from an Eighties Bill who thought he’d lost. Just like Sorkin thought E.B.’d won. The slight high whine in the room that Sorkin thinks is his Infernatron disk-drive is really the whine of Fackelmann’s high-speed mentation. His mustache roils like a cracked whip as he works his own internal mental spreadsheet. 250K in one lumpy sum represented like 375 sky-blue grams of hydromorphone hydrochloride <span id="f376"> </span><span class="calibre4"><sup>376</sup></span> or like 37,500 10-mg. soluble tablets of the shit, available from a certain rapacious but discreet Chinatown opiate-dealer who’d only deal synthetic narcs in 100-gram weights—which all translated, assuming Kite could be persuaded to pack up his D.E.C. 2100 and move far far away with Fackelmann to help him set up a street-distribution matrix in some urban market far far away, into close to like let’s see carry the one like 1.9 million in street-value, which sum meant that Fackelmann and to a lesser jr.-partner extent Kite could have their chins on their chests for the rest of their days without ever having to strip another apt., forge another passport, break another thumb. All if Fackelmann just kept his map shut about O’Shay’s confabulation of Yale/Brown//Brown/Yale, mumbled something about an I.V.-adulterant causing a sudden and temporary gigantism in one tit, and blasted out of there straight down Rte. 1 to this one Dr. Wo and Associates, Hung Toy’s Cold Tea Emporium, Chinatown.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">By this time Pamela Hoffman-Jeep had succumbed to the highballs and her own swaddled warmth and was irreversibly swooned, ice or fillip or no, twitching synaptically and murmuring to somebody named Monty that he was certainly no kind of gentleman in her book. But Gately could chart the rest of Fackelmann’s shit-creek’s course for himself. When approached by Fackelmann with a GO BROWN gym-bag of Dr. Wo’s finest wholesale Dilaudid and invited to decamp with him and set up a distrib-matrix for their own drug-empire far far away, Kite would have staggered back in horror at Fackelmann’s obviously not knowing that the bettor Eighties Bill was in fact none other than the son of Sixties Bob, viz. Whitey Sorkin’s personal migrainologist, who Sorkin trusted and confided in as only a massive I.V.-dose of Cafergot can make you trust and confide, and whom Sorkin would undoubtedly tell all about the guy’s own son’s huge win on Yale, and who wasn’t like Ward-and-Wally close with his son, Sixties Bob wasn’t, but naturally kept distant paternal tabs on him, and would certainly have known that E.B.’d in fact bet Brown in an attempt to cozy up to the conic CEO, and so would know that there’d been some kind of mix-up; and also that (Kite’d still be staggering back in horror as all this added up) plus, even if Sorkin somehow didn’t get told of Eighties Bill’s loss and Fackelmann’s scam from Sixties Bill, the fact was that Sorkin’s newest savagest U.S. muscle, Bobby (‘C’) C, old-fashioned smack-addict, copped regular old organic Burmese heroin from this Dr. Wo on a regular basis, and was sure to hear about 300+ grams of wholesale Dilaudid bought by a Fackelmann known to be C’s co-employee off Sorkin… and thus that Fackelmann, who when he came to Kite with the proposition was already in possession of a Brown-Booster bag full of 37,500 10-mg. Dilaudids and minus Sorkin’s 250K—plus with as Gately later knew only 22K in suicidal-scam-backfire-insurance capital—was already dead: Fackelmann was a Dead Man, Kite would have said, staggering back with horror at Fax’s idiocy; Kite’d have said he could smell Fackelmann already biodegrading from here. Dead as a fucking post, he’d have told Fackelmann, already worrying about being seen sitting there with him in whatever titty bar they were in when Fax hit Kite with the proposal. And Gately, watching P.H.-J. sleep, could not only imagine but Identify fully with how Fackelmann, on hearing Kite say he could smell him dead and why, with how Fackelmann, instead of taking his bagful of Blues and gluing on a goatee and immediately fleeing to climes that’d never even fucking heard of metro Boston’s North Shore—that the Faxter’d done what any drug addict in possession of his Substance would do when faced with fatal news and attendant terror: Facklemann’d made a fucking beeline for their luxury-stripped home and familiar safe-feeling hearth and had plopped down and immediately fired up the Sterno cooker and cooked up and tied off and shot up and nailed his chin to his chest and kept it there with staggering quantities of Dilaudid, trying to mentally blot out the reality of the fact that he was going to get demapped if he didn’t take some kind of decisive remedial action at once. Because, Gately realized even then, this was your drug addict’s basic way of dealing with problems, was using the good old Substance to blot out the problem. Also probably medicating his terror by stuffing himself with Peanut M&M’s, which would explain all the wrappers littering the floor of the corner he hadn’t moved from. That thus this is why Fackelmann has been squatting moist and silent in a corner of the living room right outside this very bedroom here for days; this was why the apparent contradiction of the staggering amount of Substance Fackelmann had in the gym-bag next to him together with the cornered-toad look of a man in the great fear one associates with Withdrawal. Charting and thinking, drumming his fingers absently on P.H.-J.’s unconscious skull, Gately realized he could more than empathize with Fackelmann’s flight into Dilaudid and M&M’s, but he now realizes that that was the first time it really ever dawned on him in force that a drug addict was at root a craven and pathetic creature: a thing that basically hides.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The most sexual thing Gately ever did with Pamela Hoffman-Jeep was he liked to unwrap her cocoon of blankets and climb in with her and spoon in real tight, fitting his bulk up close against all her soft concave places, and then go to sleep with his face in her nape. It bothered Gately that he could empathize with Fackelmann’s desire to hide and blot out, but in the retrospect of memory now it bothers him more that he didn’t lie there up next to the comatose girl being bothered for more than a few minutes before he felt the familiar desire that blots out all bother, and that that night he had unwrapped the cocoon of bedding and arisen so automatically in service of this desire. And feels the worst of all that he’d lumbered out of the bedroom in just jeans and belt out to the gloaming living room where Fackelmann was hunched moist and smeary-mouthed in the corner next to a mountain of 10 mg. Dilaudids and his mixing bowl of distilled water and works-kit and Sterno unit, that Gately had lumbered so automatically out to Fackelmann under the pretense—to himself, too, the pretense, was the worst thing—the pretense that he was just going to check on poor old Fackelmann, to maybe try and convince him to take some kind of action, go penitent to Sorkin or flee the clime instead of just hiding there in the corner with his mind in neutral and his chin on his chest and a stalactite of chocolated drool from his lower lip lengthening. Because he knew that the first thing Fackelmann would do when Gately left P.H.-J. and lumbered out to the defurnished living room would be to fumble in his GoreTex works-kit for a new factory-wrapped syringe and invite Gately to hunker on down and get right with the planet. I.e. ingest some of this mountain of Dilaudid, to keep Fackelmann company. Which to Gately’s shame he did, had done, and no part of the reality of Fackelmann’s creek and the need for action had even been brought up, so intent were they on the Blues’ somnolent hum, blotting everything out, while Pamela Hoffman-Jeep lay wrapped tight in the other room dreaming of damsels and towers—Gately did, he remembers vividly, he let Fackelmann fix them both up but good, and told himself he was doing it to keep Fackelmann company, like sitting up with a sick friend, and (maybe worst) believed it was true.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">(p933)</p>\r\n<h1 id="ep-23" class="block_8">(p934-p938)So and but that night’s next A.M.’d found Gately and Fackelmann</h1>\r\n<p>still there in Fackelmann’s little corner, belts around their arms, arms and noses red from scratching, still at it, the ingestion, on a hell of a tear, cooking up and getting off and eating M&M’s when they could find their mouths with their hands, moving like men deep under water, heads wobbling on strengthless necks, the empty room’s ceiling sky-blue and bulging and under it hanging on the wall overhead to their right the apartment’s upscale TP’s viewer on a recursive slo-mo loop of some creepy thing Fackelmann liked that was just serial shots of flames from brass lighters, kitchen-matches, pilot lights, birthday candles, votive candles, pillar candles, birch shavings, Bunsen burners, etc., that Fackelmann had got from Kite, who just before dawn had come out dressed and declined to get high with them and coughed nervously and announced he had to leave for a few days or more for a ‘totally key’ and unmissable software trade-show in a different area code, not knowing Gately now knew he knew Fackelmann already to be dead, w/ Kite then trying to leave discreetly with every piece of hardware he owned in his arms, including the nonportable D.E.C., trailing cables. Then a bit later, as the A.M. light intensified yellowly and made both Gately and Fackelmann curse the fact that the curtains had been stripped and pawned, as they continued to hunch and cook and shoot, at maybe 0830h. Pamela Hoffman-Jeep was up and vomiting briskly and applying mousse against the workaday day, calling Gately Honey and her Night Errand and asking if she’d done anything last night she’d have to explain to anybody today—kind of an A.M. routine in their relationship—applying blush and drinking her standard anti-hangover breakfast <span class="calibre4"><sup>377</sup></span> and watching Gately and Fackelmann’s chins fall and rise at slightly different underwater rates. The smell of her perfume and high-retsin mints hung in the bare room long after she’d bid them both Ciao Bello. As the A.M. sun got higher and intolerable, instead of taking action and nailing a blanket or something over the window they opted instead to obliterate the reality of the eye-scalding light and began truly bingeing on Blues, flirting with an O. D. They scaled Fackelmann’s Mt. Dilaudid at a terrible clip. Fackelmann was by nature a binger. Gately was typically more like a maintenance user. He rarely went on a classic-type binge, which meant plunking down in one place with an enormous stash and getting loaded over and over again for long periods without moving. But when he did start a binge he might as well have been strapped to the snout of a missile for all the control he had over length or momentum. Fackelmann was having at the mountain of 10-mg. Blues like there was no tomorrow. Every time Gately even started to bring up the issue of how Faxter had come by such a huge blue haul of the Substance—trying maybe to invite Fackelmann to confront the reality of his trouble by describing it, like—Fackelmann would cut him off with a soft ‘That’s a goddamn lie.’ This was pretty much all Fackelmann would ever say, when loaded, even in response to things like questions. You have to picture all the binge’s verbal exchanges as occurring like very slowly, oddly distended, as if the time were honey:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Serious fucking stash you managed to come by somehow right here, Fa—’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘That’s a goddamn lie.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Man. Man. I just hope Gwendine or C’s got the phone today out there, man. Instead of Whitey. No business getting done out of here today I don’t thi—’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘ ’s a goddamn lie.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘That’s for sure, Fax.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘ ’s a goddamn lie.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Fax. The Faxter. Count Faxula.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Goddamn lie.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">After a while in all the distension it got to be like a joke. Gately would haul his big head upright and try to allege the roundness of the planet, the three-dimensionality of the phenomenal world, the blackness of all black dogs—</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘ ’s a goddamn lie.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">They found it increasingly funny. After every exchange like this they laughed and laughed. Each exhalation of laughter seemed to take several minutes. The ceiling and the window’s light receded. Fackelmann wet his pants; this was even funnier. They watched the pool of urine spread out against the hardwood floor, changing shape, growing curved arms, exploring the fine oak floor. The rises and valleys and little seams. It might of gotten later and then early A.M. again. The entertainment cartridge’s myriad small flames were reflected in the spreading puddle, so that soon Gately could watch without taking his chin off his chest.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">When the phone rang it was just a fact. The ringing was like an environment, not a signal. The fact of its ringing got more and more abstract. Whatever a ringing phone might signify was like totally overwhelmed by the overwhelming fact of its ringing. Gately pointed this out to Fackelmann. Fackelmann vehemently denied it.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">At some point Gately tried to stand and was rudely assaulted by the floor, and wet his own pants.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The phone rang and rang.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">At another point they got interested in rolling different colors of Peanut M&M’s into the puddles of urine and watching the colored dye corrode and leave a vampire-white football of M&M in a nimbus of bright dye.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The intercom’s buzzer to the luxury apartment complex’s glass doors downstairs sounded, overwhelming both of them with the fact of its sound. It buzzed and buzzed. They discussed wishing it would stop the way you discuss wishing it would stop raining.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">It became the ICBM of binges. The Substance seemed inexhaustible; Mt. Dilaudid changed shapes but never really much shrank that they could see. It was the first and only time ever that Gately I.V.’d narcotics so many times in one arm that he ran out of arm-vein and had to switch to the other arm. Fackelmann was no longer coordinated enough to help him tie off and boot. Fackelmann kept making a string of chocolaty drool appear and distend almost down to the floor. The acidity of their urine was corroding the apt.’s hardwood floor’s finish in an observable way. The puddle had grown many arms like a Hindu god. Gately couldn’t quite tell if the urine had explored its way almost back to their feet or if they were already sitting in urine. Fackelmann would see how close to the surface of the pond of their mixed piss he could get the tip of the string of spit before he sucked it back up and in. The little game had an intoxicating aura of danger to it. The insight that most people like play-danger but don’t like real-life danger hit Gately like an epiphany. It took him gallons of viscous time to try and articulate the insight to Fackelmann so that Fackelmann could give it the imprimatur of a denial.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">Eventually the buzzer stopped.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The phrase ‘More tattoos than teeth’ also kept going through Gately’s head as it bobbed (the head), even though he had no idea where the phrase came from or who it was supposed to refer to. He hadn’t been to Billerica Minimum yet; he was on bail that Whitey Sorkin had bonded.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The taste of the M&M’s couldn’t cut the weirdly sweet medical taste of hydromorphone in Gately’s mouth. He watched an old stovetop-burner’s crown of blue flame shimmer in the shine of the urine.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">During a ruddled sunset-light period Fackelmann had had a small convulsion and a bowel movement in his pants and Gately hadn’t had the coordination to go to Fackelmann’s side during the seizure, to help and just be there. He had the nightmarish feeling that there was something crucial he had to do but had forgot what it was. 10-mg. injections of the Blue Bayou kept the feeling at bay for shorter and shorter periods. He’d never heard of somebody having a convulsion from an O.D., and Fackelmann had indeed seemed to bounce to his version of back.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The sun outside the big windows seemed to go up and down like a yo-yo.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">They ran out of the distilled water Fackelmann had in the mixing bowl, and Fackelmann took a cotton and sopped up candy-dyed urine off the floor and cooked up with urine. Gately appeared to himself to be repulsed by this. But there was no question of trying to get to the stripped kitchen for the distilled-water bottle. Gately was tying off his right arm with his teeth, now, his left was so useless.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">Fackelmann smelled very bad.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">When the buzzer sounded again they were watching the flames-film late at night. Now poor old Pamela Hoffman-Jeep’s voice came to them through the intercom. The intercom and apt.-complex-front-doors-unlocker button were all the way across the living room by the apartment door. The ceiling bulged and receded. Fackelmann had made his hand into the shape of a claw and was studying the claw in the light of the TP’s flames. Mt. Dilaudid was badly caved in on one side; a disastrous avalanche into Lake Urine was a possibility. P.H.-J. sounded drunk as a Nuck. She said to let her in. She said she knew they were in there. She used party as a verb several times. Fackelmann was whispering that it was a lie. Gately remembers he actually had to prod himself in the bladder to feel if he had to go to the bathroom. His Unit felt small and icy cold against his leg in the wet jeans. The ammoniac smell of urine and the breathing ceiling and drunk distant female voice… Gately reached in the dark for the bars of his playpen, grasped them with pudgy fists, hauled himself to his feet. His rising was more like the floor lowering. He wobbled like a toddler. The apt. floor below him feinted right, left, circling for an opening to attack. The luxury windows hung with starlight. Fackelmann had made his claw come alive into a spider and was letting the spider climb slowly down his chest-area. The starlight was smeary; there were no distinct stars. Everything out of the line of fire of the cartridge-viewer was dark as a pocket. The buzzer sounded angry and the voice pathetic. Gately put his foot out in the direction of the buzzer. He heard Fackelmann telling his hand’s claw’s spider it was witnessing the birth of an empire. Then when Gately put his foot down there was nothing there. The floor dodged his foot and rushed up at him. He caught a glimpse of bulged ceiling and then the floor caught him in the temple. His ears belled. The impact of the floor against him shook the whole room. A box of laminates teetered and fell and fanned clear laminates all over the wet floor. The viewer fell off the wall and cast ruddled flames on the ceiling. The floor jammed itself against Gately, pressing in tight, and he grayed out with his scrunched face toward Fackelmann and the windows beyond, with Fackelmann holding the spider out in mid-air at him for his inspection.(p938)</p>\r\n<h1 id="ep-24" class="block_8">(p974-p981)C returned shortly,</h1>\r\n<p>and at the head of a whole entourage-type group of people Gately didn’t like the looks of at all. There were DesMonts and Pointgravè, Canadian Harvard Square small-time thug-types Gately knew slightly, small-time freelancers, too Canadianly dumb for anything but the brutalest work. Gately was unglad to see them. They wore overalls and nonmatching flannel shirts. The poor eczematic pharmacist’s-assistant guy was behind them, carrying a black Dr.-bag. Gately was on his back pedalling his legs in the air, which is what anybody that’s played organized ball knows is what you do for a brody to the groin. The pharmacist’s assistant stopped behind C and stood there looking at his own Weejuns. Three big unfamiliar girls entered in red leather coats and badly laddered hose. Then poor old Pamela Hoffman-Jeep, her taffeta torn and stained and her face gray with shock, got borne in through the door by two Oriental punks in shiny leather jackets. They had their hands under her ass and carried her as if seated, one leg out and a white stick of bone protruding from her shin, which her shin was a serious mess. Gately saw all this upside-down, pedalling his legs until he could get up. One of the big girls carried an old-type Graphix bong and a Glad Cinch-Sak kitchen-can bag. Either Pointgravè or DesMonts—Gately could never remember which of them was who—carried a case of bonded liquor. C asked generally if it was Party Time. The room brightened as the sun climbed. The room was filling up. Another of the girls made negative comments about the urine on the floor. Fackelmann in the corner began saying it was all a goddamned lie. C pretended to answer himself in a falsetto and said Yes indeedyweedy it was Party Time. Now a very bland groomed collegeish guy in a Wembley tie entered with a TaTung Corp. box and put it down by where the pharmacist’s assistant was still standing, and the bland guy rehung the teleplayer on the wall and ejected the TP’s small-flame cartridge, dropping it on the wet floor. The two Oriental toughs carried Pamela Hoffman-Jeep over to a far corner of the living room, and she screamed when they dropped her onto a box of counterfeit little Commonwealth of MA peel-off seals. They were small, the Orientals, and they were looking down at him, but neither had bad skin. A small grim woman with a tight gray bun and sensible shoes entered last and shut the apt. door behind her. Gately rolled slowly to his knees and stood up, still bent a bit at the waist, not moving, one eye still swollen shut. He could hear Fackelmann trying to stand. P.H.-J. stopped shrieking and blacked out and slumped down until her chin was on her chest and her ass half off the box. The room smelled like Dilaudid and urine and Gately’s vomit and Fackelmann’s bowel movement and the red leather girls’s fine leather coats. C came on over and reached up and put his arm around Gately’s shoulders and stood with him like that while two of the tough girls in their coats passed around bottles of bourbon from the case. Gately could focus best when he squinted. The A.M. sun hung in the window, up and past the tree, yellowing. The bottles were the black-labelled boxy bottles that signified Jack Daniels. A churchbell off in the Square struck seven or eight. Gately had had a bad experience with Jack Daniels at age fourteen. The bland groomed corporate guy had inserted a different TP cartridge and now was getting a portable CD player out of the TaTung box while the pharmacist’s assistant watched him. Fackelmann said whatever it was was a total goddamn lie. Pointgravè or DesMonts took the bottle C had taken from the tough girls and handed to Gately. The sunlight on the floor through the window was spidered with shadows of branches. Everybody in the room’s shadows were moving around on the west wall. C also held a bottle. Soon just about everybody had their own individual bottle of Jack. Gately heard Fackelmann asking somebody to open his for him he was numb to the ceiling and climbing and he couldn’t feel his hands. The small grim librarianish woman went to Fackelmann, removing her purse from her shoulder. Gately was figuring out what he was going to say on the Faxter’s behalf when Whitey Sorkin arrived. Until then he figured it was C’s party and just not to unnecessarily rile C. It seemed to take a long time to formulate mental thoughts. Pamela Hoffman-Jeep’s shin looked like ground chuck. C lifted his square bottle and asked for general permission to like propose a toast. P.H.-J.’s lips were blue with shock. Gately felt bad that he felt so little romantic concern now that she’d fallen out of the tree. He spent no time wondering if she’d ratted them out, if she’d brought Bobby C to them or vice-versy. At least one of the girls in the red leather coats had an awful big Adam’s apple for a girl. C roughly turned Gately’s shoulders toward Fackelmann in the corner and toasted to old friends and new friends and what looked like a serious fucking-A score for Gene Gene the Fax Machine, given the size of this Dilaudid-pile and all the evidence of some serious fucking partying they could see, and smell. Everyone drank from their bottle. The grim-faced little woman had to help Fackelmann find his mouth with the mouth of his bottle. All three of the big women displayed Adam’s apples when they tilted way back to chug. The polite swallow of Jack almost made Gately heave. C’s Item in his belt pressed against Gately’s thigh and so did some of the belt’s spikes. DesMonts and Pointgravè both had S&W Items in shoulder-holsters. The Oriental punks didn’t display any arms but had a look about them like they didn’t ever even shower unarmed; safe bet they at least had little weird sharp chinky things you threw at people, Gately figured. Several of C’s group chugged their whole bottle. One of the big girls hurled her bottle at the west wall, but it didn’t break. Why is it you feel it in your gut and not your nuts per se, when you get brodied? Gately was turning and looking wherever C’s arm was turning him. The contorted face on the rehung viewer from the corporate guy’s cartridge was Whitey Sorkin’s, a portrait Sorkin had let some neuralgic painter do of him having a cluster-headache out at the National Cranio-Facial Pain Foundation in the city, for a series for an ad for aspirin. The cartridge seemed like just a continuous still of the painting, so that it looked like Sorkin on the wall was sort of presiding over the gathering in a mute pained way. The librarianish little woman was threading a sewing needle with thread, her mouth real tight. The pharmacist’s assistant was getting little skin-flakes all over the black bag as he hunkered down over the bag removing several syringes from the bag and filling them out of a 2500-IU ampule and handing them up to be passed around. The N.C.-F.P.F. painting had a red fist pulling a handful of brain out of the top of Sorkin’s skull while Sorkin’s face looked out of the viewer with the classic migraine-sufferer’s look of super-intense thought, almost more meditative than hurt-looking. One Oriental kid was squatting chinkishly in the corner drinking Jack and the other was sweeping up spilled laminates off the floor, using a flap from the TaTung box for a dustpan. Chinks could do some serious sweeping, Gately reflected. Another of the girls threw her bottle at the wall. It was when C didn’t even have Gately facing them that it dawned on Gately the girls in coats and slatternly hose were fags dressed up as girls, like as in transvestals. Bobby C was beaming. The first bit of real personal-ass fear Gately felt was when he realized these people looked like mostly members of Bobby C’s personal set, that they weren’t the people Sorkin would dispatch if he was sending his own people and coming himself, soon, that Sorkin’s painting on the wall was symbolic of Sorkin wasn’t coming, that Sorkin had given Bobby C free rain on this piece of painful business. The pharmacist’s assistant removed two pre-filled syringes from the bag, unwrapping their crinkly plastic. C told Gately quietly how Whitey said to say he knew Donnie wasn’t part of Fackelmann’s score to fuck Sorkin and Eighties Bill. That he didn’t need to do anything except kick back and enjoy the party and let Fackelmann face his own music and to not let any like 19th-century notions of defending the weak and pathetic drag Gately into this. C said he was sorry about the bit of the beating, he had to make sure Gately didn’t try and get Fackelmann out the window while he was down unlocking the door. That he hoped Gately wouldn’t hold it against him ’cause he wished him no particular ill and wanted no beef, later. This was all said very quietly and intensively while the two fags in wigs that had tried to break bottles were sitting on a box filling the Graphix’s huge party-bowl with grass from the Glad bag, which contained grass. DesMontes sat in a director’s chair. Everybody else was drinking out of their square bottle, standing around the sunny room in the awkward postures of way more people than seats. Their arms were pale and hairless. The two Oriental toughs were tying each other off. The draft through the fist-hole in the window made Gately shiver. The other fag was making like comments about Gately’s physique. Gately asked C quietly if he and Fackelmann couldn’t get cleaned up real quick and they could all go see Sorkin together and Whitey and Gene could reason together and work out an accord. Fackelmann found his voice and asked loudly if anybody wanted to hike on over here to Mt. Dilaudid and get fucking fucked up. Gately winced. Bobby C smiled at Fackelmann and said it looked like Fax had had about enough. But at the same time the psoriatic assistant came to Fackelmann and checked his pupils with a penlight and then shot him up with a pre-filled, using an artery in his neck.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The back of Fackelmann’s head hit the wall several times, his face flushing violently in the standard clinical reaction to Narcan. <span class="calibre4"><sup>386</sup></span> The pharmacist then came C and Gately’s way. The portable CD player started in with poor old Linda McCartney as C held Gately and the asst. pharmacist tied him off with an M.D.’s rubber strap. Gately stood there slightly hunched. Fackelmann was making sounds like a long-submerged man coming up for air. C told Gately to fasten his seatbelt. Urine had turned part of the apt.’s luxury-hardwood floor’s finish soft and white, like soap-scum. The CD playing was one C’d played all the fucking time in the car when Gately had been with him in a car: somebody had taken an old disk of McCartney and the Wings—as in the historical Beatles’s McCartney—taken and run it through a Kurtzweil remixer and removed every track on the songs except the tracks of poor old Mrs. Linda McCartney singing backup and playing tambourine. When the fags called the grass ‘Bob’ it was confusing because they also called C ‘Bob.’ Poor old Mrs. Linda McCartney just fucking could not sing, and having her shaky off-key little voice flushed from the cover of the whole slick multitrack corporate sound and pumped up to solo was to Gately unspeakably depressing—her voice sounding so lost, trying to hide and bury itself inside the pro backups’ voices; Gately imagined Mrs. Linda McCartney—in his Staff room’s wall’s picture a kind of craggy-faced blonde—imagined her standing there lost in the sea of her husband’s pro noise, feeling low esteem and whispering off-key, not knowing quite when to shake her tambourine: C’s depressing CD was past cruel, it was somehow sadistic-seeming, like drilling a peephole in the wall of a handicapped bathroom. Two of the transvestals were doing the Swim to the awful tape in the swept center of the floor; the other had one of Fackelmann’s arms while the bland guy in the Wembley tie gripped Fackelmann’s other arm and was slapping Fackelmann lightly as the Dilaudid fought the Narcan. They’d seated Fackelmann in his corner in Gately’s special Demerol-chair. Gately’s balls throbbed with his pulse. The pharmacist’s assistant’s face was right up in Gately’s. His cheeks and chin were a mess of silvery scaly flakes, and an oily sweat on his forehead caught the window’s sunlight as he gave Gately a tight smile.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘I’m pretty much straight already, C-man, after that nut-shot,’ Gately said, ‘if you don’t want to waste the Narcan.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Oh this isn’t no Narcan,’ C said softly, holding Gately’s arm.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Hadly,’ said the assistant, uncapping the syringe.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">C said ‘Hold on to your hat.’ He poked the assistant’s shoulder. ‘Tell him.’</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘It’s pharm-grade Sunshine,’ <span class="calibre4"><sup>387</sup></span> the assistant said, tapping for a good vein.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Hold on to your heart,’ C said, watching the needle go in. The pharmacist slid it in expertly, horizontal and flush to the skin. Gately had never done Sunshine. Next to ungettable outside a Canadian hospital. He watched his own blood ruddle the serum as the pharmacist extended his thumb to ease the plunger back. The pharmacist’s assistant could really boot. C’s tongue was in the corner of his mouth as he watched. The corporate guy had Fackelmann’s arms held tight and a transvestal who’d gotten in behind the chair held his head by the chin and hair as the gray lady knelt before him with her threaded needle. Gately couldn’t keep himself from watching the stuff go in him. There was no pain. He wondered for a second if it was a hot shot: it seemed like a whole lot of trouble to go to just to get him off. The pharmacist’s thumbnail was ingrown. There were a couple eczema-flakes on Gately’s arm where the guy was inclined over it. You get to like the sight of your own blood after a while. The pharmacist had him half booted when Fackelmann started screaming. The scream’s pitch got higher as it drew out. When Gately could look away from the stuff going in, he saw the librarian-type lady was sewing Fackelmann’s eyelids open to the skin above his eyebrows. As in they were sewing poor old Count Faxula’s eyes open. A kid on the playground had used to turn his lids inside out at girls like they were doing now to the poor old Faxter. Gately gave a reflexive jerk toward him, and C hugged him tight with one arm.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">‘Easy,’ C said very softly.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The taste of the hydrochloride in the Sunshine was the same, delicious, the taste of the smell of every Dr.’s office everywhere. He’d never done Talwin-PX. Impossible to get scrips for, the PX, a Canadian blend; U.S. Talwin’s <span class="calibre4"><sup>388</sup></span> got .5 mg. of naloxone mixed in, to cut the buzz, is why Gately only did NX on top of Bam-Bams. He understood they’d given Fackelmann the anti-narc so he’d feel the needle as they sewed his eyes open. Cruel is spelled with a u, he remembered. The two Orientals left the room at C’s direction. Linda McC. sounded borderline-psychotic. The little gray lady worked fast. The eye that was already sewed open bulged obscenely. Everybody in the room except C and the corporate guy and grim lady started shooting dope. Two of the fags had their eyes shut and their faces at the ceiling as if they couldn’t take watching what they were doing to their arm. The pharmacist was tying off the passed-out Pamela Hoffman-Jeep, which seemed like insult + injury. There was every different kind of style and skill-level of injection and boot going on. Fackelmann’s face was still a scream-face. The corporate-tool type was dropping fluid from a pipette into Fackelmann’s sewed-open eye while the lady rethreaded the needle. It was just seeming to Gately he’d seen the fluid-in-eye thing in a cartridge or movie the M.P.’d liked when he was a Bim playing ball on the chintz in the sea when the Sunshine crossed the barrier and came on.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">You could see why the U.S. made them cut the buzz. The air in the room got overclear, a glycerine shine, colors brightening terribly. If colors themselves could catch fire. The word on the C-II Talwin-PX was it was intense but short-acting, and pricey. No word on its interaction with massive residual amounts of I.V.-Dilaudid. Gately tried to figure while he still could. If they were going to eliminate his map with an O.D. they’d have used something cheap. And if the librarian was going to sew his eyes open. Gately was trying to think. Too they wouldn’t have got him. Him. Got him off.</p>\r\n<p class="block_9">The very air of the room bulged. It ballooned. Fackelmann’s screams about lies rose and fell, hard to hear against the arterial roar of the Sun. McC. was trying to muffle a cough. Gately couldn’t feel his legs. He could feel C’s arm around him taking more and more of his weight. C’s arms’s muscles rising and hardening: he could feel this. His legs were, like: opting out. Attack of floors and sidewalks. Kite used to sing a ditty called ‘32 Uses For Sterno Me Lad.’ C was starting to let him down easy. Strong squat hard kid. Most heroin-men you can knock down with a Boo. C: there was a gentleness about C, for a kid with the eyes of a lizard. He was letting him down real easy. C was going to protect Bimmy Don from the bad floor’s assault. The supported swoon spun Gately around, C moving around him like a dancer to slow the fall. Gately got a rotary view of the whole room in almost untakable focus. Pointgravè was vomiting chunkily. Two of the fags were sliding down the wall they had their backs to. Their red coats were aflame. The passing window exploded with light. Or else it was DesMontes that was vomiting and Pointgravè was taking the TP’s viewer off the wall and stretching its fibroid wire over toward Fackelmann against the wall. One of Fax’s eyes was as open as his mouth, disclosing way more eye than you ever want to see on somebody. He was no longer struggling. He stared piratically straight ahead. The librarian was starting on his other eye. The bland man had a rose in his lapel and he’d put on glasses with metal lenses and was blind-high and missing Fax’s eye with the dropper half the time, saying something to Pointgravè. A transvestal had P.H.-J.’s torn hem hiked up and a spiderish hand on her flesh-colored thigh. P.H.-J.’s face was gray and blue. The floor came up slowly. Bobby C’s squat face looked almost pretty, tragic, half lit by the window, tucked up under Gately’s spinning shoulder. Gately felt less high than disembodied. It was obscenely pleasant. His head left his shoulders. Gene and Linda were both screaming. The cartridge with the held-open eyes and dropper had been the one about ultra-violence and sadism. A favorite of Kite. Gately thinks sadism is pronounced ‘saddism.’ The last rotating sight was the chinks coming back through the door, holding big shiny squares of the room. As the floor wafted up and C’s grip finally gave, the last thing Gately saw was an Oriental bearing down with the held square and he looked into the square and saw clearly a reflection of his own big square pale head with its eyes closing as the floor finally pounced. And when he came back to, he was flat on his back on the beach in the freezing sand, and it was raining out of a low sky, and the tide was way out.
