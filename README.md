This github project containse various shell scripts I have written over time to make my life easier

The audio directory has files that downsample audiobooks to 32kb mono, split large files into smaller 5min long files, etc.
The create-new-disk directory has the script to build a new hard drive from an existing one
The cron directory has crontabs from my various computers
The ffmpeg directory has the script used to build ffmpeg on a computer
The id3 directory has various scripts to apply id3 tags to audio files. There are so many different scripts because my media collection has various directory structures
The infinite-jest directory has the scripts to take David Foster Wallace's Infinte Jest audiobook and split it into individual chapters and then rearrange those chapters so that the book is in chronological order (mostly)
The misc directory has scripts for doing things like counting the number of files in a directory.
The opera directory has scripts to make dvd iso images from mp4 files, etc.
The subsonic directory has a java program used to determine the type of audio device for a computer. This used to be important for earlier versions of subsonic in order to make the jukebox mode work. I believe that this is no longer a problem with the latest version of subsonic
The sync-media directory has my scripts for sync my media collection across my many backups
The ubuntu directory has a script for installing the programs i typically use in ubuntu. I run this after a new installation of ubuntu
